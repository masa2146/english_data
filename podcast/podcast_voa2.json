    "dialog": "\n\nWe meet Anna's co-workers at The Studio: Anna, Jonathan, Amelia, Kaveh, and Penelope. Rumors of budget cuts travel through the office. But who is going to get fired?\n \n\n\n\nAnna: Hum. Oh! “Important meeting. Everyone must come.” Well, back to work! And my boss has called a meeting. I wonder what it's about. Maybe we're all getting raises! Ooo, there's Jonathan! Maybe he knows.\nProfessor Bot: Hi! I'm Professor Bot! This video is all about work. People talk about jobs and things that happen at work. Your assignment is to find as many work words as you can. Don't worry, I'll help.\nAnna: So, Jonathan, what do you think today's meeting is about? The email sounded important.\nJonathan: Well, I have heard people in the building talking about budget cuts.\nAnna: Oh! Budget cuts? Wait, who has been talking about budget cuts?\nJonathan: Mark in Accounting.\nAnna: Mark in Accounting? That's one person. That's not “people.”\nJonathan: I know, but Mark knows everything that goes on at The Studio.\nAnna: That is true. But wait, look at us. We shouldn't gossip. That's how rumors start. We'll just go to the meeting and see what happens.\nJonathan: You're right. No more talk about budget cuts.\nAmelia: Budget cuts? Oh no!\nAmelia: I just heard Anna and Jonathan talking about budget cuts.\nKaveh: That must be what the meeting is about. When there are budget cuts, people lose their jobs.\nAmelia: Not you. You're a good reporter.\nKaveh: And it's not you. You've done a great job as a videographer.\nAmelia: I can't go back to being a detective. Criminals scare me!\nKaveh: And I can't go back to being a teacher! High school kids scare me!\nProfessor Bot: Did you hear any work words? They talked about a lot of jobs. You can make the name of a job by adding an ending to a verb! Kaveh reports, so, he's a reporter. Amelia used to detect, so she was a detective. If you teach, you're a teacher. And a videographer….uh, I think you understand. Back to the story.\nKaveh: Penelope, have you heard the news? Today's meeting is about budget cuts.\nPenelope: That's awful! What should I do?\nKaveh: Update your résumé. I’ve already updated mine. I’ll see you at the meeting.\nMs. Weaver: Hello everyone! Quiet, please. Quiet, please!\nMs. Weaver: This meeting won’t take long. Then you can all leave.\nMs. Weaver: What is wrong with everyone? You look like I'm going to fire you. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, what is wrong with everyone?\nAnna: Excuse me, Ms. Weaver?\nMs. Weaver: Yes, Anna.\nAnna: Well, everyone has been worrying about, you know … We’ve been worrying that you are going to fire us!\nMs. Weaver: I’m not going to fire any of you! No! The reason for this meeting is to tell you what a good job you’ve been doing and give out new assignments. Budget cuts have been happening. But only one person has lost their job -- Mark in Accounting? Now, let’s talk about those new assignments.\nProfessor Bot: Ms. Weaver's team is doing a good job! How did you do? Did you find all of the work words? Here's a list you can check.\n \n\n\nboss\nmeeting\nraises\nemail\nbudget cuts\n\n\nAccounting\ngossip\nrumors\nlose\nreporter\nrésumé\n\nvideographer\ndetective\nteacher\nupdate\nfire\nassignment\n\n\naccounting - n. the skill, system, or job of keeping the financial records of a business or person\nassignment - n. a job or duty that is given to someone\nboss - n. the person whose job is to tell other workers what to do\nbudget - n. an amount of money available for spending that is based on a plan for how it will be spent\ncalm - adj. not angry, upset, excited, etc.\ncriminal - n. a person who has committed a crime or who has been proved to be guilty of a crime by a court\ndetective - n. a police officer whose job is to find information about crimes that have occurred and to catch criminals\nemail - n. a system for sending messages from one computer to another computer\nfire - v. to dismiss (someone) from a job\ngo on - phrasal verb. happen\ngossip - v. to talk about the personal lives of other people\nlose - v. to fail to keep or hold \nraise - n. an increase in the amount of your pay\nrésumé ​ - n. a short document describing your education, work history, etc., that you give an employer when you are applying for a job​\nrumor - n. information or a story that is passed from person to person but has not been proven to be true\nscare - v. to cause (someone) to become afraid\nupdate - v. to change (something) by including the most recent information\nused to - v. used to say that something existed or repeatedly happened in the past but does not exist or happen now\nvideographer - n. a person who records images or events using a video camera\n \n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Make Inferences. That means making a guess based on what you know.\nIn the video, you hear Amelia tell Kaveh: \"I just heard Anna and Jonathan talking about budget cuts. Kaveh makes an inference when he says, \"That must be what the meeting is about. When there are budget cuts, people lose their jobs.\"\nAs you learn English, you can use this strategy to help when you do not understand every word you hear or read. Making an inference means you guess, using what you do understand, about new words or expressions in English.\n \n\n\n\n​\n\n\nSend us an email if you have comments on this course or questions.\nGrammar focus: \nReview: Present Perfect (has/have + past participle) Present Perfect gives the idea of completion.\nNew: Present Perfect Continuous (has/have + been + ing verb)\nPresent Perfect Continuous sometimes focuses on something unfinished and how long something has been happening. \nTopics: Agent Nouns, New occupations, Evaluating People's Activities\nLearning Strategy: Make Inferences\n \n\nNow it's your turn.

    "dialog": "\n\nMs. Weaver asks Anna to team up with a person who is different from her. Who will she find?\n\n\n \n\nAnna: Ms. Weaver is giving new assignments out. I am ready to take on anything she gives me. Well, except reporting traffic from a helicopter. Wish me luck.\nProfessor Bot: I wonder what Anna’s new assignment will be? Professor Bot here! While you are watching, look for phrasal, or two-word verbs. Some stay together, like “go back” and some can come apart, like “give [assignments] out.” Good luck, Anna!\nMs. Weaver: So, as I said at the meeting last week, I have new assignments for everyone at The Studio. Anna, you're good at asking questions. So, I want you to go back to hosting and reporting. \nAnna: That sounds great.\nMs. Weaver: You're also a team player. So, I want you team up with someone ...\nAnna: That sounds even better!\nMs. Weaver: ... someone who is very \"different\" from you.\nAnna: That sounds ... what do you mean \"different\"?\nMs. Weaver: Well, you are very cheerful, you're a people person. I want you to team up with someone who ... isn't.\nAnna: Ms. Weaver, I will find that person.\nMimi: Excuse me. Are you using this chair?\nPete: Yes.\nAnna: Pete, hi! Thanks for meeting me.\nPete: Sure. But I don’t have lots of time, Anna. I’m busy looking for work.\nAnna: Pete, you can tear these want ads up and throw them away! I have good news!\nPete: Anna, I was working on that crossword puzzle. \nAnna: Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Pete, forget about the crossword puzzle. I have a job offer for you!\nPete: I'm listening.\nAnna: My boss wants me to team up with someone to host a talk show. But the person must be different from me. So, I thought of you. \nPete: Different from you? What do you mean?\nAnna: I'm sorry, Pete, I don't have time right now. Here's my boss's address. Your interview is tomorrow morning at 10 am.\nPete: But what do you mean “different”?\nAnna: Just be yourself, Pete. Just be yourself.\n\nProfessor Bot: Did you find any two-word verbs? Here’s one example. Pete can throw the wants ads away! Throw away is a two-word verb.\nMs. Weaver: Thanks for coming in, Pete.\n\nPete: Thanks for the opportunity, Ms. Weaver.\nMs. Weaver: I need to find out if you have the skills for this job. And I want you to be completely honest.\nPete: Okay.\nMs. Weaver: First, let's talk about your personal skills. Pete, are you a people person?\nPete: Well, okay, sometimes I think people talk too much.\nMs. Weaver: Pete, what work of yours are you most proud of?\nPete: Last year, I locked myself in a cabin and wrote a book. I didn't speak to anybody the entire time! It was the best two months of my life.\nMs. Weaver: Okay. I think I’ve heard enough.\nAnna: Hey! Hey, Pete, how was the interview with Ms. Weaver?\nPete: Well, she said I was grumpy and not good with people. \nAnna: And … ?\nPete: And, I got the job!\nAnna: I knew it! Congratulations! Let's go celebrate.\nPete: Okay!\nProfessor Bot: Did you find more two-word verbs? Here is the list.\n\ngive out\n\nfind out\n\ntake on\n\ntear up\n\ngo back\n\nthrow away\n\nteam up\n\ncome in\n\n \n\n\ncome in - phrasal verb. to enter a place\nfind out - phrasal verb. to learn (something) by making an effort\ngive out - phrasal verb. to give (something) to many people or to hand out (something)\ngo back to - phrasal verb. to return to a person, place, subject, or activity\ntake on - phrasal verb. to begin to deal with (something, such as a job or responsibility)\nteam up- phrasal verb. to join with someone to work together\ntear up - phrasal verb. to completely destroy (something) by tearing it into pieces\nthrow away - phrasal verb. to put (something that is no longer useful or wanted) in a trash can, garbage can, rubbish bin\n \n\ncabin - n. a small, simple house made of wood\ncheery - adj. having or causing happy feelings\ncrossword puzzle - n. a puzzle in which words that are the answers to clues are written into a pattern of numbered squares that go across and down\ngrumpy - adj. easily annoyed or angered, having a bad temper or complaining often\nhelicopter - n. an aircraft that can stay in the air without moving forward and that has metal blades that turn around on its top\nhost - v. to talk to guests on a television or radio show\noffer -n. the act of giving someone the opportunity to accept something\nlock - v. to fasten (something) with a lock\npeople person - n. a person who enjoys or is particularly good at interacting with others\npersonal skills - n.

Learners who set goals put a powerful idea into their own minds: \"I will do this by this time.\" For example, \"I will improve my English speaking skills so I can talk with a friend for five minutes in English by next September.\"\nIn this lesson, Anna sets a goal: she wants to find someone who is different from herself. Ms. Weaver asked Anna to team up with someone for her new show. Anna asks different people first. Then, she asks Pete, and he says he will talk to Ms. Weaver. She met her goal of finding the right person for the job.\nHow about you? What is your goal for learning English? How will you use Let's Learn English Level 2 to help meet your goal?

    "dialog": "\n\nWhen Pete and Anna meet with Director Kelly, they arrive late. Both tell very different stories about their morning. A show begins.\n\n\n \nAnna: Today, Pete and I are meeting with a consultant who will help us with our new show. Yesterday, Pete had promised to meet me here at 8:00 am. but he did not come on time.\nProf Bot: Uh-oh. It’s bad to be late for a business meeting. But while we wait for Pete, let’s talk about a new verb tense -- past perfect! You know the past tense, right? Like, \"Pete promised to meet me here at 8:00 a.m.\" Past perfect is a little different. When we talk about two things in the past, we can use the past perfect for the first event. Put \"had\" before the past participle. \"Pete had promised he would meet Anna.\" Here's your assignment: find sentences with the past perfect tense. Remember, look for \"had!\"\nKelly: You two are late -- exactly 43 minutes late! What happened?\nAnna: He had to get his \"special\" coffee -- SPECIAL coffee!\nPete: She had to feed her birds -- HER birds!\nKelly: Okay, I can see already that you need my help. You can’t both talk at the same time. You have to take turns. Alright, Anna, you go first.\nAnna: Sure. Kelly, see, Pete and I live in the same building. So, we decided to meet at 8:00 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. to come to work together. I had waited 15 minutes when Pete arrived! \nAnna: After Pete had wasted time waiting for coffee, we were late. I left you a message.*\nKelly: Hum. I didn’t get that message.\nAnna: Oh. Sorry.\nKelly: Pete?\nProf. Bot: Anna left a message. That’s the right thing to do. Did you find some examples of the past perfect sentences? I did. Anna said, \nAnna: \"After Pete had wasted time waiting for coffee, we were late.\nLook at that coffee! It looks more like dessert! Okay, keep watching for past perfect!\nPete: Yeah, that’s not why we’re late. This is why we’re late: I had arrived on time at 8:00 a.m. but didn’t see Anna. She was standing behind a tree. I think she was hugging it. I always walk to work. But she said that would take too long and that a scooter would be much faster. It was awful. I hated it. And it added too much time to our commute!\nThen Anna stopped by a pond to feed the birds. She had named them after characters from books and yelled the names out loud … Romeo! Juliet! Sherlock! \nBy the time she had fed all the birds, we were late.\nKelly: This is what I think. You two see the same event very differently. Does this happen often with you two?\nPete: Yes.\nAnna: No.\nPete: No.\nAnna: Yes.\nKelly: Okay. This is good. This is good! It’s good to see things differently. I have an idea: we will call the show \"He Said, She Said.\" For every story, you tell a different point of view.\nAnna: That is a great idea, Kelly! Pete, we are different. That’s why I thought of you for this job!\nKelly: I think you two understand perfectly.\nAnna: Let’s get to work!\nKelly: She named the birds? Really?\nPete: Yeah…\n* Business people in the U.S. think you should come to a meeting at the exact time. If you are late to a business appointment, you should call and explain why.\n\n\n\ncommute - v. to travel regularly to and from a place and especially between where you live and where you work\nconsultant - n. a person who gives professional advice or services to companies for a fee\nevent- n.  something (especially something important or notable) that happens\nexactly - adv. used to stress that something is accurate, complete, or correct\nhug - v. to put your arms around someone especially as a way of showing love or friendship\npoint of view - n. a way of looking at or thinking about something\npond - n. an area of water that is surrounded by land and that is smaller than a lake\npromise - v. a statement telling someone that you will definitely do something or that something will definitely happen in the future\nscooter - n. a child's vehicle that is made of a narrow board with two small wheels attached\nwaste - v. to use (something valuable) in a way that is not necessary or effective\n \n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Monitor. As you use English, you can check your understanding. Do you understand? If not, what is the problem? You can also check how you write or speak. Are you making sense? If not, what is the problem?\nIn this lesson, Anna monitored the time of her commute to work. She knew that she and Pete were late. She called Kelly to tell her. Later, Anna and Pete told Kelly the problem. Kelly monitored the different things that they said and had a great idea. They can have different ideas on their new show: \"He Said - She Said!\"\nHow about you? How do you monitor while you are speaking English?

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna and Pete start their new show. They do not agree about the circus. Are the performers artists or athletes? Do they perform or compete? Find out in the first \"He Said - She Said\" show.\n\n\n\n\nAnna: Hello, I’m Anna …\n\nPete: … and I’m Pete. Welcome to “He Said,\nAnna: … She Said”!\nPete: Because there are always two sides … \nAnna: to every story!\nAnna: Today’s show is about Circus Arts!\nPete: Circus? That’s not an art form.\nAnna: Yes, it is.\nPete: No, it isn't.\nAnna: Yes, it is.\nPete: No, it isn't.\nAnna: Yes, it is!\nPete: No, it isn't.\nAnna: Yes, it is!\nPete: No, it isn't.\nAnna: Yes, it is!\nProfessor Bot: Oh dear. Anna and Pete do not agree about Circus Arts. But that's okay. Today’s lesson is about agreeing and disagreeing. Let’s listen to how Anna and Pete disagree or agree. Let’s hope these two can agree on something.\nAnna: Today, let’s run away with the circus!\nRecently, I went to a circus festival. There was a huge circus tent. And many different circus performers. It was a celebration of circus arts!\nPete: That looks fun, Anna. But I don’t think circus performers are artists. I think they’re athletes with interesting skills … and costumes.\nAnna: Hmm, that is a very interesting point of view, Pete. And I completely disagree.\nPete: Anna, Michelangelo was an artist. Rembrandt was an artist. People who swing from ropes are not artists. I know it’s not easy to swing from a bar and catch someone by the hands. You have to be very athletic to do that.\nAnna: That’s a good point, Pete. They are athletic. But they are called trapeze artists. Trapeze … ARTISTS.\nPete: I hear what you’re saying, Anna. I do. But where is the art? Look at these guys. They’re jugglers.\nAnna: Yes, they are skilled in the art of juggling.\nPete: They have a special skill. But are they artists?\nAnna: Yes!\nPete: No!\nPete: They're just throwing things back and forth.\nAnna: Kind of like you and me, Pete. We’re going back and forth on this issue.\nPete: I don’t think we’ll ever agree on this one.\nAnna: No, but we can agree that these young people are amazing.\nPete: Okay, yeah. We can agree on that. But, still, they are very athletic – flipping and throwing each other around.\nAnna: Yes, I agree with you on that point.\nProfessor. Bot: They did it! They agreed!! Anna says she agrees that the performers are athletic. \"That’s a good point, Pete. They are athletic. I agree with you on that point. \" Now look for other ways they agree.\nPete: Anna? Anna!!\nAnna: Sorry! Sorry! But he’s an artist too. He is telling a story with his sticks and his costume.\nPete: What story? What costume?\nAnna: I see your point, Pete. I really do. But circus performers do more than physical tricks. Look! Look at these amazing performers!\nPete: I will admit -- I like their costumes.\nAnna: You know, Pete. Let’s let the performers speak for themselves.\nAnna: Kate and Piper tell stories while hanging upside down on a ring!\nPete: Was it hard to interview them upside down?\nAnna: I interviewed them right side up, Pete. Kate says circus performing may be athletic but it’s not competitive. With most sports, you compete.\nKate: It’s an art form because like, other sports are competing. This is simply performing and having fun.\nPete: Okay, Kate made a really good point. In athletics, there is a lot of competition. But still …\nAnna: Here’s Piper, Pete. Please pay attention, Pete.\nPete: But, I -\nAnna: Shh.\nPiper: Well, when you’re up in the air doing circus you have to perform. And so, we learn to embody characters, and to move fluidly and gracefully … in artistic ways.\nAnna: And that …is why they are artists!\nPete: You’re right, Anna. Oh, you’re right. It’s just so beautiful. \nAnna: I know. I know, Pete.\nProfessor Bot: Good job you two! I'm so glad that Anna and Pete finally agree! Pete said, \" You’re right, Anna.\" I agree, too. Circus arts are beautiful. Remember the website!\n \n\n\nadmit - v. to say usually in an unwilling way that you accept or do not deny the truth or existence of (something)\nathlete - n. a person who is trained in or good at sports, games, or exercises that require physical skill and strength\nathletic - adj. strong and muscular\nback and forth - adv. toward the back and then toward the front or backward and forward\nbar - n. a straight piece of metal or wood that is used as a tool\ncircus - n. a traveling show that is often performed in a tent and that typically includes trained animals, clowns, and acrobats\ncompetitive - adj. of or relating to a situation in which people or groups are trying to win a contest or be more successful than others\nembody - v. to be a symbol or example of (something)\nform - n. a type or kind of something\ngraceful - adj. moving in a smooth and attractive way\nhang - v. to hold one's body in the air\nMichelangelo - n. Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was an Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer. Along with Leonardo da Vinci, he is often called a \"Renaissance man\" which means that he had great talent in many areas.\nRembrandt - n. Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was a famous Dutch painter and artist. He is generally considered one of the greatest painters and printmakers in European art history, and the most important in Dutch history.\nright side up - adv. with the top of something, or the head of a person, facing upward\nring - n. something that is shaped like a circle\nrope - n. a strong, thick string that is made by twisting many thin strings or fibers together\nrun away with - phrasal verb. to secretly leave a place with a person or a group\nside - n. one of two or more opinions, positions, etc., that disagree with each other\ntrapeze - n. a short bar that is hung high above the ground by two ropes and that is held by circus performers who perform athletic tricks on it\ntwirl - v. to turn or spin around and around\n \n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Apply a rule. When you use English, you often apply rules you have learned. If you are not sure about how to say something in English, you can look for a rule that will help you.\nIn this lesson, Anna and Pete are talking about circus performers. Are they artists or athletes? Anna thinks of this rule: 'athletes compete in sports.' The performer Kate says circus performing may be athletic but it’s not competitive. Anna helps Pete to understand that circus performers are artists because, as Piper says, they move \"in artistic ways.\"\nHow about you? How do you apply rules while you are speaking English? Can you think of an example of a rule that you applied recently? Write to us in the Comments section or send us an email. \n \n\nSee how well you understand this lesson by taking a listening quiz.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna goes to a travel agent to find the Best Vacation Ever! But does she? Travel agent Dan wants to sell her the Most Expensive Vacation Ever. But does he?\n\n\n\n \nAnna: “Do you need a vacation?” Wow. That was the best vacation I have ever had … in my head. A beach is much better than here. I need a vacation!\nProfessor Bot: I hear you, Anna. I need a vacation too but not at the beach. Sand is not good for robots! When we compare things, we use special forms of adjectives. \"Better\" is a comparative adjective. That is used to compare two things. \"Best\" is a superlative adjective. It shows that one thing has more of ...something than ALL of the others. Try to find more of these adjectives. Look for ER or EST at the end.\nDan: NO! You can’t get your money back. I don’t care that it was your worst vacation ever!\nDan: Hello! Have a seat! Welcome to the World’s Best Vacation Travel Agency!\nAnna: Thank you and congratulations!\nDan: For what?\nAnna: For being the world’s best travel agency.\nDan: Right … thanks.\nDan: Trudy, hold my calls. I am going to sell our most expensive vacation.\nTrudy: Sure thing, Boss. \nDan: The Mountain Getaway is good for you. It’s a little pricey. But think of it -- you, on top of a mountain for seven days!\nAnna: I’m afraid of high places.\nDan: Of course you are. That’s why our Deep Sea Adventure is better for you! It is pricier than the Mountain Getaway. Just you and the animals of the sea!\nAnna: Shark! Shark!\nDan: No, there are no sharks in your dream vacation! You need the Safari Camp Out! It is our priciest vacation. But I think it’s the best one for you. During the day, you’ll see elephants, giraffes and lions. At night, you’ll sleep out under the stars.\nAnna: Look, I think this was a bad idea.\nDan: Sure, you can leave. But then you won’t see the latest vacation technology.\nProfessor Bot: Did you find all of those adjectives? Dan started with good - The mountain getaway; then he moved to better - The Deep Sea Adventure. And finally, he said the Safari Campout was the best vacation for Anna!\nAnna: Exactly what is the “latest vacation technology” … exactly?\nDan: I’m happy you asked. Meet the Travel Max 2000!\nAnna: Wow.\nDan: So, tell me, how do you like to travel?\nAnna: Well, I like travel that is cozy and romantic but still exciting.\nDan: Great. Tell me more.\nAnna: I like traveling in a plane but not in a helicopter! Planes are a little scary but helicopters are scarier! My favorite way of traveling is by train. Ships can be the scariest! Have you seen the movie “Titanic”? Oh, and no horses. But I will ride a camel. And no bike tours. Biking is THE slowest AND least romantic way to travel. Excuse me, but I think the Travel Max 2000 is on fire.\nDan: Yes, we’re both on fire! We really want to sell you the most ex-, I mean, best vacation ever!\nAnna: No, I mean it’s really on fire!\nDan: You killed it. You killed the Travel Max 2000!\nAnna: I am so sorry! Can I help you fix it?\nDan: No, no!\nAnna: Don’t cry. I know what you need -- a vacation!\nAnna: The Safari Campout looks fun. It is the priciest. But I think you deserve it.\nDan: No, no!\nProfessor Bot: Oh Anna. This is the smokiest lesson yet! There were a lot of comparatives and superlatives but … I can’t breathe. Just go to the website to learn the best ways to use them!\n \n\n\n\nagency - n. a business that provides a particular service\ncamel - n. a large animal of Africa and Asia that has a long neck and one or two large humps on its back and that is often used for desert travel\ncampout - n. an occasion when people go camping together\nCongratulations -n. a message telling someone that you are happy because of his or her success or good luck\ncozy/cozier - adj. small, comfortable, and warm\ndeserve - v. used to say that someone or something should or should not have or be given something\ngetaway - n. a short vacation\nlatest - adj. most recent\nleast - adj. smallest in amount or degree\non fire - expression. in the process of burning / feeling very strong enthusiasm, love, etc.\npricey - adj. costing a lot of money​\nsink - v. to go down below the surface of water\nsmoke - n. the cloud of black, gray, or white gases and dust that is produced by burning something​\ntechnology - n. the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems​\nvacation - n. a period of time that a person spends away from home, school, or business usually in order to relax or travel​\nworst- adj. least appropriate, useful, or helpful\n\n \n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is ​Make Associations. We make associations between words and ideas each time we use language. When learning a second language, it is best to connect new words or sentence patterns directly with ideas or experiences, not with words in your first language. The associations may help you remember new words better.\nIn this lesson, Anna makes associations between mountains and high places. She is afraid of high places, so she does no want to go to the mountains. She is also afraid of wild animals, which she associated with the Safari Campout. So she decides not to take those vacations.\nHow about you? How do you make associations while you are speaking English?

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna takes Penelope around the city on a tour vehicle. Is it a bus? Is it a boat? Yes! The Duck Bus/Boat. It goes on land. It goes on water.\n\n\n\nPenelope: Anna, thanks for taking me on a tour of D.C. today.\nAnna: Sure thing, Penelope. You are new to town. And a tour is the best way to see more of the city!\nPenelope: So, which tour are we taking – the one that goes through the city on a bus? Or the one that goes along the river in a boat?\nAnna: Both!\nPenelope: What? Anna, this isn’t going to be one of those trips, is it?\nAnna: No. Follow me.\nProfessor Bot: In this lesson, you are going to hear lots of prepositions! What’s a preposition, you ask? It’s a word that shows relationships between things. Anna says they are going on a tour through the city and along the river. Through and along are both prepositions. Watch for more!\nAnna: Well, Penelope, there’s our ride!\nPenelope: What is it?\nAnna: It’s the famous DC Ducks -- the boat with wheels! We will ride on the road and then sail on the water!\nPenelope: Who thinks of these things?\nAnna: I don't know. But I’m glad they do! Let’s get aboard, Sailor!\nPenelope: (looking at a brochure about the boat) Hey, did you know that this bus … um, boat was created during World War II to carry people and supplies?\nAnna: Wow. You know, a tour is so much more interesting with Fun Facts, like that one.\nPenelope: I agree. I love Fun Facts!\nBoy: Did I hear you say you love Fun Facts?\nAnna & Penelope: Yeah.\nBoy: Well, I have tons of Fun Facts for this tour!\nAnna & Penelope: Great!\nAnna: Penelope, where are his parents?\nPenelope: Maybe - maybe he’s the Captain’s son and he helps his dad on tours!\nAnna: Oh yeah! It would be so awesome to ride around the city in a boat all day with your dad!\nPenelope: This is amazing, Anna. There are so many beautiful buildings along this road!\nAnna: Hey, the Washington Monument is on the left!\nProfessor Bot: I have a Fun Fact too! Did you know that the Washington Monument was damaged in an earthquake? Whoa. Did you feel that?!\nI heard: \"around the city in a boat,\" \"along this road and \"on the left.\" All of these are prepositions showing place. Let's watch for more places and prepositions!\nPenelope: Look, Anna, we’re across from the White House!\nAnna: Penelope, the only thing between us and the President is the street … and a park … and a security gate .... and police officers … with guns.\nBoy: Excuse me, do you want to know a Fun Fact about the White House?\nAnna & Penelope: Yes!\nBoy: Inside the White House there is a swimming pool, a movie theater and 32 bathrooms!\nPenelope: Thirty-two bathrooms! That’s a lot of bathrooms!\nBoy: I’d be happy with two. I live in a house with my mom, four sisters, two aunts and only one bathroom!\nPenelope: Oh my! You know, Anna, we should give him a tip!\nAnna: Of course! It is polite to tip your tour guide! Luckily, I have lots of dollar bills!\nPenelope: That was a great Fun Fact! Here you go!\nBoy: Thank you! I can tell you Fun Facts all day!\nProfessor Bot: Did you hear any more prepositions of place? I heard \"between us and the president\" “inside the White House\" and \"in a house.\"\n And did you hear that the Duck Boat can go on the river? I don't believe it. Join us next time to find out which preposition we will use: The boat went ON the river or The boat went INTO the river?\n\n\n\naboard - prep.  on or into (a train, ship, etc.)\nacross - prep. on the other side of (something)\nalong - prep. in a line matching the length or direction of (something)\naround - prep.over or in different parts of (a place)\nbetween - prep. in the space that separates (two things or people)\ncaptain - n. a person who is in charge of a ship or an airplane\ncarry - v. to move (something) while holding and supporting it\ninside - prep. an inner part of something (such as a building or machine)\npool - n. (swimming pool) a large structure that is filled with water and that is used for swimming\nrelationship - n. the way in which two or more people or things are connected\nsecurity gate - n. a place where people are checked to make sure they are not carrying weapons or other illegal materials\nthrough - prep. used to describe movement within a place or an area of land, air, etc.\ntip - n. an extra amount of money that you give to someone (such as a waitress or waiter) who performs a service for you\n- v. to give an extra amount of money to someone who performs a service for you\ntour - n. an activity in which you go through a place (such as a building or city) in order to see and learn about the different parts of it\nwheel - n. one of the round parts underneath a car, wagon, etc., that rolls and allows something to move\n \n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Access Information Sources. When we are learning about something, we often have several choices for finding out the information we need. Sometimes we can read a book, or look on the internet. At other times, we can ask a teacher, friend or classmate for information. No matter what the source is, you can then add the information to your own knowledge.\nIn this lesson, Penelope looks at a brochure to learn more about the tour boat. Then a young man tells her some \"Fun Facts\" so she can learn more about Washington, D.C. \nHow about you? How do you access information sources? When you are learning English, do you look for information in books, dictionaries, or online? Are you able to ask teachers, friends or classmates to help you by sharing their knowledge of English?

They carved “EUTURE”!\nAnna: Well, we all make mistakes.\nBoy: Yeah, but this mistake was carved in stone!\nAnna: You’re right. That is pretty bad. Here’s another dollar!\nPenelope: More fun facts, please! (Crossing the river) I love riding over bridges! The water looks so pretty from here!\nAnna: Penelope, this is amazing!

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna goes to a barbecue battle in Washington, D.C. She learns that there are secret ingredients in the sauces. And people are VERY loyal to their favorite kind of barbecue.\n\n\n\n \nAnna: Thanks for meeting me.\nKelly: Sure.\nAnna: I’d like to get your advice on my latest project.\nKelly: Of course. I heard you were sent to cover a big food festival that has all kinds of barbecue. So, how did it go?\nAnna: Well, things started out great! But then, well, maybe you should watch it yourself.\nProf. Bot: Hi English learners! Your lesson today is about my favorite food -- barbecue! Your assignment is to find passive sentences. What are those, you might ask? In passive sentences the subject receives the action! \nFor example, “Anna was sent to cover a food festival.”\nPassive sentences have a form of the BE verb + the past participle of the main verb. This lesson is LOADED with passive sentences. Hey! That’s a passive sentence, too!\nOkay, now, it’s Barbecue Time!\nAnna: Today, a Barbecue Battle is being held in Washington, D.C. This festival, which is known as one of the biggest food festivals in the United States, brings together barbecue lovers from all over the country! Barbecue is meat that is cooked over an open fire or on a grill.\nChicken, pork and beef are all common meats to grill on a barbecue! No matter which meat you like to barbecue, the sauce is very important. Sauces are taken very seriously by chefs. Most ingredients are kept secret!\nSo, can you tell us what is in your barbecue sauce?\nChef 1: No, I can’t tell you.\nAnna: So, tell us, what is the secret ingredient in your barbecue sauce?\nChef 2: (says nothing.)\nAnna: Sauces are made by the barbecue chefs themselves. Most sauces are made with a tomato sauce, vinegar, and spices.\nProf. Bot: How many passive sentences did you find? Here is one I found:\nToday, a Barbecue Battle is being held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Now you try. Turn this sentence from passive to active.\nBarbecue is loved by Prof. Bot.\nProfessor Bot loves Barbecue!\nGood job! And yes, I do.\nAnna: There are some areas of the U.S. that are known for their tasty barbecue. The states of Texas, North and South Carolina and the cities of Memphis and Kansas City are known as the Barbecue Belt. People who are loyal to barbecue are really loyal to their favorite barbecue. That is why this festival is called a battle! Let’s ask a couple of people which barbecue is best.\nPerson 1: Texas, of course!\nPerson 2: Carolina barbecue is the very best.\nPerson 3: Kansas City!\nPerson 4: Memphis style!\nPerson 3: Kansas City!\nPerson 5: Texas!\nPerson 3: Kansas!\nPerson 5: Texas!\nPerson 3: Kansas!\nPerson 5: Texas!\nPerson 3: I say Kansas.\nPerson 5: Texas!\nPerson 3: She keeps saying Texas, I say Kansas.\nAnna: This is Anna Matteo reporting.\nAnna: Kelly, people feel so strongly about barbecue. Unbelievable! So, what do you think of my project?\nKelly: This is what I think. There is no way that Texas has the best barbecue. I am from Kansas City and we have THE best barbecue in the whole country. My mother and father owned a barbecue restaurant, which was really famous! So, I know barbecue! Anna, I know barbecue! I know barbecue! I know barbecue!\nProf Bot: Oh my. Kelly knows a lot about barbecue! And you know more about passive sentences! Be sure you go to the website to learn even more! Ah! Now, if you excuse me .. I'm hungry\n\n\nbarbecue - n. a flat metal frame that is used to cook food over hot coals or an open fire\nbarbecue - v. to cook (food) on a barbecue or to broil or roast (meat, fish, etc.) over hot coals or an open fire\nbattle - n. a fight between people or groups in which each side tries to win a contest (such as a game or an election) \nbrown sugar - n. a type of sugar that is brown because it contains a dark syrup (called molasses)\nchef - n. a professional cook who usually is in charge of a kitchen in a restaurant\ngrill - n. a metal frame that is used to cook food over hot coals or an open fire\n- v. to cook (food) on a metal frame over fire\nloyal - adj. having or showing complete and constant support for someone or something\nmolasses - n. a thick, brown, sweet liquid that is made from raw sugar\nsauce - n. a thick liquid that is eaten with or on food to add flavor to i\nspice - n. a substance (such as pepper or nutmeg) that is used in cooking to add flavor to food and that comes from a dried plant and is usually a powder or seed\nspicy - adj. of food. flavored with or containing strong spices and especially ones that cause a burning feeling in your mouth\nsweet - adj. containing a lot of sugar\ntasty - adj. having a good flavor\ntomato - n. a round, soft, red fruit that is eaten raw or cooked and that is often used in salads, sandwiches, sauces\nvinegar - n. a sour liquid that is used to flavor or preserve foods or to clean things\n\n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Ask Questions. One of the best ways to learn is to ask many questions.\nIn this lesson, Anna asks the barbecue chefs questions like, \"Where does the best barbecue come from?\" and \"What is the secret ingredient in your sauce?\" She gets many opinions on the best barbecue, but she never learns about the secret ingredient in the sauce.\nHow about you?

And some were pretty strange.\nAnna: There was a contest to see who could spit a watermelon seed the farthest. You should have seen all the people who wanted to spit a watermelon seed! And, it was pretty fun to watch. But Ashley, the pet contests were the best. There was a pet parade. Lots of people walked with their dogs.\nAshley: That sounds so fun. But Anna, tell me, how did you win a pet contest without a pet?\nAnna: Okay, the closest thing I have is my pet rock.\nAnna: I know it’s silly, but I’ve had it since I was a little girl. So, for a joke, I brought it to the fair. But then I was invited to enter the “One-of-Kind Pet” contest. And I won!

Let’s go!\nBruna: There's this very special Peruvian dance called Marinera Norteña.\nAnna: I love the Marinera Nortina… !\nBruna: Marinera Norteña.\nAnna: Marinera Norten… ?\nBruna: No. Marinera Norteña.\nAnna: I love the … marriage dance!\nAnna: Bruna, I read about this dance. But it is much more romantic in person!\nBruna: The dancers are giving lessons after their performance. You should try it!\nAnna: I’d love to. But I’m not ready to get married. I mean, one day I hope to meet the right guy. We’ll buy matching motorcycles and ride into the sunset -- the wind blowing through our hair!\nBruna: Anna, the dance just shows the courtship tradition. It doesn’t mean you will get married.\nAnna: Oh. Well, I’ll try anyway.\nBruna: Don’t forget. This festival also shows Peruvian art!\nAnna: I hope I have time to see everything!\nBruna: Anna, I wish I could join you. But I have some work to do.\nAnna: Of course, of course. You go back to work. I’ll check out the art.\nBruna: Okay, I’m hoping to finish in about an hour. Let’s meet then.\nAnna: Great. See you then!\nBruna: See ya!\nProf. Bot: Did you notice any sentences with hope or wish?\nAnna says, “One day I hope to meet the right guy.” That’s an example of using “hope” with an infinitive to talk about doing something in the future. Keep watching!\nAnna: Oh, wow! I can make my own Peruvian art!\nBruna: Anna, how’s it going?\nAnna: Hi, Bruna!\nBruna: You know you're in the kid's section, right?\nAnna: I'm in the art making section.\nBruna: I see that. Your art is very nice. I wish I could do art like that.\nAnna: Oh, this one’s not mine. This is mine.\nBruna: Wow! Really? That's really nice!\nAnna: Thanks! And thanks for telling me about this festival. I learned so much about Peru. Ooh, we still have time!\nBruna: Time for what?\nAnna: Time for Marinera Norteña!\nProf. Bot: Do you remember what Anna said? “I really want to understand Peru.” I hope you understand Peru a little better now, too. And I wish I could talk with you more about grammar, but that’s all the time we have today! Go to the website to learn more!\n\n\nblow - v. to be moved or affected in a specified way by the wind\ncourtship - n. he activities that occur when people are developing a romantic relationship that could lead to marriage or the period of time when such activities occur\ndeadline - n. a date or time when something must be finished\nhope - v. to want something to happen or be true and think that it could happen or be true\nin person - expression used to say that a person is actually present at a place\njoin - v. to put or bring (two or more things) together\nmarriage - n. a ceremony in which two people are married to each other\nmatch - v. to have the same appearance or color\nmotorcycle - n. a vehicle with two wheels that is powered by a motor and that can carry one or two people\nPeru - n. a country in South America\nromantic - adj. of, relating to, or involving love between two people\nsunset - n. the time when the sun goes below the horizon in the evening\nwish - v. to want (something) to be true or to happen\n\n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is ​Use Sounds. That means you can use your \"mental tape recorder\" to listen carefully and notice new sounds. For example, when you are learning English there may be some new sounds that you do not have in your native language.\nIn this lesson, Anna hears the name of a dance from Peru. Bruna says, \"There's this very special Peruvian dance called Marinera Norteña.\" At first, Anna has trouble saying the name. She says, \"I love the Marinera Nortina… !\" Bruna says it again, so Anna can hear it correctly. Later, Anna says the name with the correct sound: \"Time for the Marinera Norteña!\"\nHow about you?

    "dialog": "\n\nA big snow is coming. Anna and Pete work all weekend to report on it. Have they both prepared for the blizzard? Let's find out!\n\n\n\nKelly: Hi, Anna. Why do you have all this weather stuff?\nAnna: I love weather.\nKelly: Me too! Weather is so important.\nAnna: It is. It affects people’s lives!\nKelly: Have you ever reported on a big weather event?\nAnna: I have. I’ve reported on a blizzard.\nKelly: Do mean the one last weekend?\nAnna: Yes! I had been waiting for that blizzard for years. When it came, I was ready.\nProf. Bot: Welcome to our most perfect lesson! Why is it perfect? Today we are reviewing the present perfect and past perfect verb tenses. These show that an action is completed.\nKelly uses the present perfect when she says,\nKelly: Have you ever reported on a big weather event?\nAnna uses the past perfect when she says,\nAnna: I had been waiting for that blizzard for years.\nListen for \"have\" or \"had\" and the past participle to find more sentences with the perfect tense. I'll color those words to help you.\nAnna: I have wanted to report on a big weather event my whole life.\nKelly: Who hasn’t? Did you report all weekend ... by yourself?\nAnna: No, no. I volunteered Pete to help me.\nPete: Why am I here on a Saturday? Why are you carrying things? Why? Why?\nAnna: Pete, these are my supplies – food, a blanket; warm clothing. Where are your supplies?\nAnna: Pete, Pete, Pete. This could be the “blizzard of the century.”\nPete: It’ll be fine. \nKelly: How else had you prepared?\nAnna: Well, I had just bought the latest weather forecasting software. So, I brought it!\nKelly: Do you mean The Weather Genie Pro?\nAnna: You know it. Pete thought it was pretty great too.\nPete: Do you have any games on that thing?\nAnna: Yes! I have the best weather survival game. Boom! \nPete: Sounds fun.\nAnna: It is. But right now, Pete, this computer is a work tool. It will give us the temperature, wind speed, wind direction and amount of snowfall … in real time! Boom, boom!\nPete: I can’t wait.\nAnna: Pete, we need a name for this blizzard.\nPete: No, we don’t.\nAnna: All the great storms have names.\nPete: No, they don’t.\nAnna: I know -- “The Big Snow!”\nPete: I am not saying “The Big Snow.”\nPete: Welcome to “The Big Snow.”\nKelly: The Big Snow broke all kinds of records, didn’t it?\nAnna: Yes it did. And every time a record was broken, we celebrated!\nAnna: So far, in Washington, D.C. 29 inches of snow has fallen. That, my dear listeners, is a record! (Honks horn)\nAnna: We just broke the wind speed record! (Honks horn)\nAnna: Snow has been falling for 30 hours straight! That’s another record! (Honks horn. Pete comes into room and breaks the horn.)\nKelly: By Saturday night, stores and restaurants had closed. Did you bring enough food?\nAnna: I thought I had brought enough food. But I ran out.\nAnna: Hey, Pete, where is my bag of popcorn?\nPete: Maybe you ate it already. \nAnna: No, I didn’t.\nPete: I haven't seen it. (Pete has popcorn in his beard. Anna tries to hit him.)\nAnna: We had reported together for 48 hours straight!\nKelly: Wow. That must have been a great team-building exercise for you and Pete.\nAnna: Yeah. You - you could say that.\nProf. Bot: I hope you found all the sentences with perfect tenses.

That means to look for patterns in what you are learning. For example, we use many patterns to communicate: groups of sounds, letters, and words get our meaning across.\nIn this lesson, Pete sees a pattern in Anna's celebration of the weather records. Each time a weather record breaks, she honks her horn to celebrate. Pete does not like the horn, so he breaks it before Anna celebrates the next record-breaking weather fact. He is applying his understanding of a pattern to make his life quieter.\nHow about you? How do you find and apply patterns? Can you see patterns in the way people use English? How about in literature? There are also patterns in math, science, history, music and social studies. Can you think of a time when knowing about a pattern helped you to learn something?

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna is afraid of bees. Her friend Kaveh tells her to talk with Caroline, a beekeeper and bee educator. Will Anna fight her fear and learn to love bees?\n\n\n\n(blue text shows conditional sentences)\n\nAnna: Wow. Did you know that bees are dying?\nKaveh: That is bad news. If all the bees died, there would be no food. Bees are very important.\n(buzz sound)\nAnna: Yes, they are. Speaking of bees, one of our little friends is here now.\nKaveh: You know, Anna, if you ignore it, it will fly away. But if you swat it, it might sting you.\nAnna: I’ll ignore it. I can ignore it. See, I’m ignoring it. (she is swatting at the bee) \nKaveh: Anna, are you afraid of bees?\nAnna: What makes you say that?\nKaveh: Anna, you should call my friend, Caroline. She is a beekeeper and a bee educator. If you talk to her, she’ll probably help you get over your fear of bees.\nAnna: I am not afraid of bees.\nKaveh: Here’s her card.\nAnna: Ahhh!\nProf. Bot: In this lesson, you can learn about conditionals. They have \"if\" and \"will\" or \"would.\" There are two kinds of conditional sentences in this lesson.\nType 1 conditionals have a real event, and a result that probably will happen. Chances are good. Here is the pattern:\nIf +present tense verb ... will + future tense verb.\nKaveh uses this when he says: \"If you ignore it, it will fly away.\"\nType 2 conditionals have a possible event and a result that may or may not happen. We don't know. Here is the pattern:\nIf + past tense verb ...would + infinitive verb.\nKaveh uses this pattern when he says, \"If all the bees died, there would be no food.\"\nLook for the \"if\" in a sentence to find more conditionals in today's lesson. I'll color them, too!\nAnna: I think I'm at the wrong address. This does not look like a place where bees are kept. ​(knocks on door)\nAnna: Oh, sorry to bother you. I’m looking for beekeeper Caroline. I’m here to take her “Learn to Love Bees!” class. \nCaroline: You’re in the right place! I’m Caroline!\nAnna: Oh, nice to meet you! Um, Caroline, I thought this class used real bees and real hives.\nCaroline: It does! If you look in my backyard, you will see my bees! I’m a home beekeeper! \nAnna: What? You live with bees? That is really amazing! And at the same time really scary.\nCaroline: It’s not scary. If you come, I’ll show you.\nAnna: Caroline, how many bees are in that hive?\nCaroline: About thirty thousand (30,000) in each.\nAnna: What? That's amazing! But, aren’t you afraid that they are gonna come out and kill you? \nCaroline: No, not at all, Anna. Even my children help me. Tell me, why are you afraid of bees?\nAnna: I don't know. Well, when I was a little girl my mom ran out of honey. And I really wanted honey for my pancakes. So, I climbed high into a tree and hit a beehive with a stick … several times. Then I reached inside with my bare hands to pull the honey out. That’s when I got stung … a lot.\nAnna: Caroline, if you hit a beehive with a stick and reach inside, you might get stung. \nCaroline: No, Anna. If you do those things, you will get stung.\nAnna: Yes. I did.\nCaroline: And you know that it was your fault you got stung, don’t you?\nAnna: Yes. I did.\nCaroline: Bees know your feelings. And if you stay calm, the bees will be calm. If you're nervous, the bees will be nervous. And if bees are nervous, they may sting. So, please be calm.\nAnna: I will be calm. I am calm. Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready\nCaroline: Great. Let’s get our equipment on.\nAnna: Wait! Wait! I’m not ready! I'm nervous! Give me a minute to be calm.\nProf. Bot: Are you ready for one more conditional sentence?\nIf you are not afraid, you will join us next time to learn more about bees!\n\n\nattack - v. to try to hurt, injure, or destroy (something or someone)\nbackyard - n. an area of grass behind someone's house\nbare - adj. not covered by clothing, shoes or a hat\nbee - n. a black and yellow flying insect that can sting and that is often kept in hives for the honey that it produces\nbeekeeper - n. a person who raises bees\ncalm - adj. not angry, upset, or excited\nfault - n. responsibility for a problem, mistake, or bad situation\nhive - n. a nest for bees\nhoney - n. a thick, sweet substance made by bees\nignore - v. to refuse to show that you hear or see (something or someone)\nlocal - adj. relating to or occurring in a particular area, city, or town\nprobably - adv. very likely or almost certainly\nrun out of (something) - phrasal verb to use up the available supply of (something)\nsting - v. of an insect, plant, or animal - to hurt (someone) by piercing the skin with a sharp, pointed part that usually contains poison\nswat - v. to hit (someone or something) with a quick motion\n \n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Sequence. That means to look for the order of events in what you are learning. For example, we use a sequence when we write about a process, like how to make a pizza: \"first, you mix the dough, next, you make the sauce...\"\nIn this lesson, Anna thinks about the sequence of her experience with a beehive as a child. First, she hit the hive with a stick. Next, the bees came out and stung her. They were angry. Thinking about that sequence will make Anna more careful about hitting a beehive with a stick in the future! Caroline agrees: \"If you do those things, you will get stung.\"\nHow about you? How do you sequence when you are learning English? Do you start with easier patterns and move on to the harder ones?

    "dialog": "\n\nLast time, Anna went to visit a home beekeeper. She was nervous. Does Anna go into the hive? Or will she continue to live in fear of bees?\n\n\n\n(blue font shows conditional sentences)\nProf. Bot: We are back with Anna and Caroline and the bees. Last time, Anna was afraid. (Anna: I'm not afraid of bees!) But Caroline is helping her to stay safe. Look at sentences that start with \"If\" to find more conditional sentences. Remember, Type 1 conditionals use the present tense and \"will,\" and Type 2 use the past tense and \"would.\" Now, let's find out what happens with Anna and the bees.\nCaroline: I have a feeling that your fear of bees will be gone soon. There are things beekeepers do to protect ourselves. For example, we wear protective clothing. This is a beekeeper’s veil, suit and gloves. There are other things we can do, too. If I use a smoker, the bees will stay calm. \nAnna: Let’s use smoke … lots of smoke.\nCaroline: Okay, Anna, that’s enough smoke. Another thing you can do is stay calm. Okay. When I lift the frame, you will see the bees. \nAnna: I’m ready. Let's do this thing!\nCaroline: Okay, let's put on our protective clothing. \nCaroline: I will carefully take out a frame. This is where the bees live. There are worker bees, drone bees and the queen bee. The bees have different jobs. The queen bee lays the eggs. The worker bees collect nectar and pollen ​from flowers and bring it back to the hive. Then they make honey! Now, you hold the frame. There are the bees.\nAnna: There are so many! And they are so busy! Now I know why we say, “busy as a bee!”\nCaroline: Good job, Anna.\nAnna: Caroline, bees are beautiful and important. If I wanted to help the bees, what would I do?\nCaroline: Great question. You can plant native flowers that bees like. Here’s a book to help you know which ones to plant. \nAnna: It’s a beautiful book. And look, it tells you which bees like which types of flowers. \nCaroline: It also tells you how the flowers affect the flavor of the honey. \nAnna: Flowers make a big difference to bees. If they don’t eat, they won’t live. \nCaroline: Buying local honey also helps the bees. If you want to help bees, do those two things. \nProf Bot: I learned a lot about bees. Hey, if I worked with bees, I would not need protective clothing! Guess what? That was a Type 2 conditional. And I heard a Type 1 conditional, too. (Anna: If they don’t eat, they won’t live.)\nAnna: Thanks for the book, Caroline, and the bee puppet and for teaching me about bees. Look … I’m not scared. \nCaroline: Good job, Anna. If you ever want to see the bees again, I’ll be here! You have my business card. I'll let you see yourself out. \nAnna: Thanks! Bye! I will plant tons of flowers! \nBees: Thanks, Anna. (bees spell out the words)\nAnna: Sure thing, bees! Oh, and I'm sorry about hitting that hive when I was a little girl.\nBees: We love you, Anna. (bees make a heart sign.)\nAnna: Take care, bees! (to herself) Which way is the Metro?\nBees: That way. (they draw an arrow)\nAnna: Thanks! \nProf. Bot: So, if I you want to learn more about bees, visit your local beekeeper like Anna did. Maybe you can try some local honey, too.\nNow it’s your turn. Practice making conditional sentences. If you practice, you will become better at them. That's type 1!\n\n\naffect - v. to act on (someone or something) and cause a change\ndifference - n. the quality that makes one person or thing unlike another\nflavor - n. the quality of something that you can taste\nflower the part of a plant that is often brightly colored, that usually lasts a short time, and from which the seed or fruit develops\nframe - n. an open structure that holds something\nlift - v. to move (something or someone) to a higher position (raise)\nlocal - adj. relating to or occurring in a particular area, city, or town\nnative - adj. produced, living, or existing naturally in a particular region\nnectar - n. a sweet liquid produced by plants and used by bees in making honey\npollen - n. the very fine usually yellow dust that is produced by a plant and that is carried to other plants of the same kind usually by wind or insects so that the plants can produce seeds\nprotective - adj. used to protect someone or something : giving or meant to give protection\nsmoker - n. a piece of equipment used for making smoke\nveil - n. something that covers or hides something else\n\n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Make Predictions. That means to make a guess about what will happen. When you are reading a story in English, if you look at the title and the pictures, you can sometimes guess what the story will be about. Predicting helps you get ready to learn new things, based on things you already understand.\nIn this lesson, Caroline says, \"I have a feeling that your fear of bees will be gone soon.\" She is predicting that Anna will stop being afraid of bees. She can guess that because she has taught other people who feared bees. When they learned about bees, they were not afraid.\nYou can predict in other subjects, too, like science. In science class, they call it making a hypothesis. How about you? How do you make predictions when you are learning English?

Anna says she has a new boyfriend but Pete and Ashley don't believe her. Is he real or not?\n\n\n\n\nAnna: Hello! What are you guys looking at?\nPete: I’m showing Ashley pictures of my girlfriend. We have so much in common -- even small things. She can’t whistle and I can’t either.\nAshley: (to Pete) And here’s a picture of my boyfriend. (sighs)\nAshley: My family is big and so is his. I don’t like ball sports and he doesn’t either! (sighs) We are made for each other ...\nPete: … and so are we. (sighs)\nAnna: Uh… you have found perfect partners … and so have I!\nProfessor Bot: Pete and Ashley are talking about people they love. They are putting two ideas together with connectors.\nLet’s start with these two sentences: She can’t whistle. Pete can’t whistle. How do you put them together?\nPete says, \"She can’t whistle and I can’t either.\"\nYou can see we just add the conjunction “either” and take away the verb “whistle.” And Ashley says: \"I don’t like ball sports and he doesn’t either!\"\nKeep looking for connectors!\nAshley: You met someone, Anna? That’s great! What’s his name?\nAnna: His name? His name is uh… (stalling, looks around, sees a bus) Bus … ter. (stalling, looks around, sees a car)  Car … ter.\nAshley: (says it like Anna did) Bus...ter Car...ter? \nAnna: It’s just Buster Carter, Ashley. I like him and he likes me. We’re a great couple.\nAshley: Hey, let’s all get dinner tonight, together. You can bring Buster.\nPete: (laughing) Yeah, I can’t wait to meet him. \nAnna: Thanks, Ashley, but he’s really busy tonight with his uh, (looks around, sees squirrel) squirrel collection. Bye, guys! Gotta go!\nAshley: Squirrel collection?\nPete: You know, she made all that up.\nAshley: That’s so sad. She needs to meet someone. Hey, do you know anyone who she might...\nPete: No.\nAnna: (to herself) Anna, Anna, you lied! You lied! Now, they think you have a boyfriend - with a squirrel collection. Here, squirrel. (throws food) Well, you need to tell them the truth. You don’t have a boyfriend.\nMan: Excuse me, is this seat taken?\n(Anna shyly shakes head “no”) \nAnna: Ashley, Pete, I need to talk to you. This morning, I lied. \nPete: Let me guess. There’s no Buster Carter. What a surprise!\nAnna: I’m sorry. But later I really did meet someone and we have a lot in common!\nHe’s good at flying kites and so am I.\nHe likes to read comics and so do I.\nI can play the ukulele and so can he.\nAshley: He sounds perfect for you, Anna. Can he come tonight?\nAnna: That’s the sad part. You see, he just got a job as a spy, and tonight he leaves on assignment.\nPete: Of course he does.\nAnna: But that's okay, because now I know that there is someone out there made for me. (looks at the time) Oh, it’s late! I have to see him off at the train station. Bye, you guys!\nAshley: Bye Anna! Oh dear, she’s worse than we thought.\nPete: She’s lost her mind.\nAshley: What should we do?\nPete: (happy, excited) Let’s tell her!\n(Pete goes to leave but Ashley pulls him back.)  \nAshley: No, Pete. Mr. Right may not be real but he makes her really happy. \nProfessor Bot: Did you find any other connectors? Notice how the words are in a different order in the part after “so.” \"I am\" becomes \"am I\" and \"he can\" becomes \"can he.\" \n\"He’s good at flying kites and so am I. I can play the ukulele and so can he.\"\n\n\n\nboyfriend - n. a man that someone is having a romantic or sexual relationship with\ncollection - n. a group of interesting or beautiful objects brought together in order to show or study them or as a hobby\ncouple- n.  two people who are married or who have a romantic or sexual relationship\ngirlfriend - n.  a woman that someone is having a romantic or sexual relationship with\nin common - expression. people who have something in common share interests, beliefs, attitudes, or opinions\nkite  - n. a toy that is made of a light frame covered with cloth, paper, or plastic and that is flown in the air at the end of a long string\nlie - v. to say or write something that is not true in order to deceive someone\nmake (something) up - phrasal verb. created from the imagination or not true or real\nMr. Right - expression. the ideal future husband\npartner - n. someone's husband or wife or the person someone has sexual relations with\nsquirrel - n.  a small animal with a long tail and soft fur that lives in trees\nsee (someone) off - phrasal verb. to go to an airport, train station with (someone who is leaving) in order to say goodbye\ntruth - n.  the real facts about something\nwhistle - v.  to make a high sound by blowing air through your lips or teeth\n \n\n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is self-evaluate. That means to think about how well you are learning. And to think about how your strategies for learning are working. Do your strategies help you learn more easily?\nIn this lesson, Anna self-evaluates when she thinks about lying to her friends Ashley and Pete. She knows it was wrong to lie. After she self-evaluates, she goes back to tell Ashley and Pete the truth. \nHow about you? How do you evaluate yourself when you are learning or using English?

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna hires a trainer to get back into shape. Her trainer does not read her application carefully. So, he offers her a workout program that she does not enjoy. \n \n\n\nAnna: Penelope, even though we both love speed walking, could we slow down a bit?\nPenelope: No way! I think because I’m walking with you, I’m walking faster.\nAnna: Come on, Penelope. Let's take a break. We've been speed walking since 8 a.m.! You're so competitive! You even wore your medals!\nPenelope: You brought your trophies! You’re out of shape. When we were little girls, we could speed walk all day! (pulls ahead)\nAnna: (chases her) Hey, wait for me! Hey, you know the speed walking rules! If both feet leave the ground, it’s running! You ran!\nProf. Bot: Anna and Penelope are doing something they both love - speed walking!\nThey are also using adverb clauses.\nAdverb clauses tell us when, why, how, where and under what conditions.\nFor example, \"since 8 a.m.\" tells us when.\nAdverb clauses are dependent clauses and need an independent clause to make a complete sentence.\nWords like before, after, when, because, since, if and even though can signal an adverb clause.\nKeep watching for more adverb clauses!\nPenelope: Whew! That was great!\nAnna: (Anna catches up) Wow, Penelope, you’re still really fast! Since I’ve been working in an office, my speed walking has been much slower.\nPenelope: You are slower, Anna. Maybe you should hire a personal trainer.\nAnna: That will be great. As long as the trainer understands speed walking.\nPenelope: (hands her a business card) Try this company. After you fill out an online application, they will match you to the perfect trainer.\nAnna: As soon as I get home tonight, I’ll do it! Thanks.\nAnna: Are you my trainer?\nAlaskan Albert: If you’re Anna, then I’m your trainer -- Alaskan Albert. Because I’m from Alaskan wilderness, I’m skilled in all outdoor activities of the wild.\nAnna: That’s great but what about speed walking?\nAlaskan Albert: Speed walking? That's funny! Since I’ve been living in the city, I’ve combined wilderness training with a city workout. I call it “Call of the Wild Parkour!” (He howls like a wolf.) \nAnna: Okay … but seriously, when do we speed walk?\nAlaskan Albert: Your application did not say how funny you are!\nAnna: No. But it did say that I'm a speed walker! Did you read it? Forget it. We'll have to cancel.\nAlaskan Albert: Why?\nAnna: We can't train today because it's too cold and too windy.\nAlaskan Albert: No way! No pain, no gain! When you exercise in really cold weather, you feel alive!\nAnna: Really? Because right now I just feel cold.\n Alaskan Albert: You're so funny. But seriously, after our training, you will be ready for any extreme physical challenge. Let's get started!\n(He leads Anna through some parkour exercises.)\nAlaskan Albert: Anna, even though you’re trying really hard, you’re really bad at Call of the Wild Parkour. (he howls)\nAnna: I'm bad at Call of the Wild Parkour because I don’t want to do Call of the Wild Parkour! (she howls) I am a speed walker. It’s what I do. It’s part of who I am.\nAlaskan Albert: Why didn’t you say something?\nAnna: I did. Several times! You thought I was joking.\nAlaskan Albert: Now I understand. Anna, I can help you., if you follow my advice, I'll put the speed back in your speed walk.\n(He shows her how to improve her speed walking)\nAlaskan Albert: Go, Anna, go!\nProf. Bot: For more about adverb clauses, visit our website!\n\n\nadvice - n. an opinion or suggestion about what someone should do\napplication - n. a formal and usually written request for something\nchallenge - n. a difficult task or problem or something that is hard to do\ncompetitive - adj. having a strong desire to win or be the best at something\nextreme - adj. (sports) unusual and dangerous\nfill out - phrasal verb. to complete something by providing necessary information\nfollow - v. to be guided by (something)\nno pain, no gain - expression. If you want to improve, you must work so hard that it hurts.\nparkour - n. the activity or sport of moving rapidly through an area, typically in an urban environment, negotiating obstacles by running, jumping, and climbing.\npersonal trainer - n. a person who teaches or coaches athletes or animals\nphysical - adj. relating to the body of a person instead of the mind\nskilled - adj. having the training, knowledge, and experience that is needed to do something\nthough - adv. used when you are saying something that is different from or contrasts with a previous statement\nwild - n. a wild, free, or natural place, state, or existence\n \n\nThe learning strategy for this lesson is Access Resources. That means to find help as you learn. Sometimes that help can come from a book or an electronic dictionary. At other times, you can find help from other learners or teachers.\nIn this lesson, Anna looks for help from a personal trainer. She has forgotten how to speed walk well. Penelope thinks that the trainer can help Anna, so she gives Anna his card. Anna accesses resources when she asks the trainer for help.\nThere are many resources you can access as you learn English.

    "dialog": "\n\nMs. Weaver gives Anna and Pete a new assignment: make a show about single parents. But first, she wants them to try out parenting for themselves... \n \n\n\nMs. Weaver: Anna, Pete, I have a new assignment for you -- a show on single parents! What is it like for a mother or a father to raise a child by herself or himself?\nAnna: We can interview single parents. They can share their experiences themselves.\nMs. Weaver: Yes, but you need to experience parenthood yourselves.\nAnna: Ourselves?\nPeter: Yeah, how do we do that? We’re not parents.\nMs. Weaver: I asked myself the same question. I said, \"Caty, how are they gonna do that?\" Then an idea came to me. I will give you the babies!\nProfessor Bot: You may be asking yourself the same thing that I’m asking myself: what is Ms. Weaver talking about!? I am sure we will find out shortly.\nThis lesson teaches reflexive pronouns.\nReflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of a sentence or clause. We use them when the subject and the object are the same person or thing. \nFor example, Ms. Weaver says, “I asked myself the same question.”\n“I” is the subject and “myself” refers back to it. Here, she would not use the pronoun “me.” You need to use the reflexive pronoun “myself.”\nReflexive pronouns are easy to find: they end in “self” or “selves.” I have a feeling we are going to see a lot of reflexive pronouns. Listen for them!\n(Pete and Anna continue their meeting with Ms. Weaver. She puts two bags of flour on the table. Pete and Anna still look confused.)\nMs. Weaver: Here are your babies!\nPete: Those are bags of flour. \nMs. Weaver: No, Pete, for the next six days, this is your baby. Here are your instructions. Do not leave your babies alone. A baby cannot take care of itself. And you two must do everything by yourselves.\nWe will meet next Friday. Oh, and the person who does the best research will get an extra day of vacation. Help yourself to a baby.\nAnna: Pete, look, my baby is organic and whole grain. Your baby is ordinary.\n(Pete pushes her flour baby off desk.)\nAnna: (to Pete) Monster! (to Caty) This is a great idea, Ms. Weaver!\n(Pete and Anna are now outside.)\nPete: This is a terrible idea.\nAnna: Speak for yourself, Pete! We need to throw ourselves into the research! I’m starting right now!\n(She leaves but forgets her Flour Baby.)\nPete: Hey Anna, you forgot your baby!\n(She turns and looks at Pete.) \nAnna: Come to mama! \n(The bag of flour flies at her. She catches it.)\nAnna: Good girl! Good girl!\nProfessor Bot: Singular reflexive pronouns end in “self.” Plural ones end in “selves.”\nAnna says, “We need to throw ourselves into the research!” The subject “we” is plural. So, we must use the plural reflexive pronoun “ourselves.”\n(The parenting research begins. Anna tries to open a baby stroller but can’t. A man walking by helps her. She pushes Flour Baby in the stroller but it falls out. On another day, she jogs with it. After several days, she is tired!) \nAnna: This is hard! I hope Pete is not doing well. I really need that vacation day!\nProfessor Bot: We will all see how Pete is doing in the next episode. We’ll also learn when not to use reflexive pronouns. \n \n\n\nexperience – n. the process of doing and seeing things and of having things happen to you\ngonna – informal. In casual conversation, most Americans change “going to” to “gonna.”\ninstructions – n. statements that describe how to do something\nordinary – adj. normal or usual\nmonster – n. an extremely cruel or evil person\nparenthood – n. the state of being a mother or father\nrefer – v. to have a direct connection or relationship to something\nsingle – adj. not married or not having a serious romantic relationship with someone\nspeak for yourself - expression. something you say to someone to say that the opinion that they have just expressed is not the same as your opinion\nstroller - n. a small carriage with four wheels that a baby or small child can ride in while someone pushes it​\nterrible – adj. very shocking and upsetting\nthrow (reflexive pronoun) into – expression. to begin to do something with great energy and determination\n\n \n\nNow, practice the grammar you just learned!\nUse the Comments section below to tell us about taking care of a baby (real or not), or maybe an animal. You can talk about yourself, or maybe a friend or family member/s. What happened? How did it go?\nUsing Reflexive Pronouns\n\nWe use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object of the sentence or clause are the same person or thing. \nEx: I asked myself the same question. \nSubjects and their reflexive pronouns:\n\n\nI…myself\nYou…yourself\nHe…himself\nHer…herself\nOne…oneself\nIt…itself\nWe…ourselves\nYou…yourselves\nThey…themselves\n\nA reflexive pronoun can be a direct object, indirect object or an object of the preposition.\nDirect Object:\nEx: A baby cannot take care of itself.\nIndirect Object:\nEx: I asked myself the same question.\nObject of the Preposition:\nEx: Anna and Pete are experiencing parenthood for themselves. \nTo show emphasis:\nSometimes, we use reflexive pronouns simply to emphasize the person or thing in the sentence or clause. In this case, the reflexive pronoun often appears at the end of the sentence:\nEx: Anna took care of the baby herself.\n\nWe do NOT use reflexive pronouns:\nAfter prepositions of place\nEx: Anna found the flour baby in the kitchen herself. (wrong) \nAnna found the flour baby in the kitchen. (right) \nAfter these verbs: meet, feel, relax, concentrate\nEx: They will meet themselves at The Studio next Friday. (wrong)\nThey will meet at The Studio next Friday. (right)\nAfter verbs that describe things we normally do for ourselves, such as dress, shave and wash​\nEx: Anna got dressed herself for a day with her new flour baby. (wrong)\nAnna got dressed for a day with her new flour baby. (right)\nDon't miss the next episode when we'll talk more about when not to use reflexive pronouns!\n \n\nSee how well you understand this lesson by taking a listening quiz.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna and Pete complete their parenting experiment. But which one did a better job? And who will win the extra day of vacation?\n\n\n\nProfessor Bot: In Part 1 of this two-part lesson, Ms. Weaver gave Anna and Pete an assignment. Ms. Weaver instructed them to do everything by themselves.\n“Themselves” is a reflexive pronoun.\nIn today’s lesson, Ms. Weaver will look at Pete’s and Anna’s research. First, let’s see Pete’s experiment.\n(Pete throws the bag of flour on his chair and throws many other things on his flour baby. Next, we see him outside enjoying ice-cream without his flour baby.) \nMs. Weaver: Okay, Pete, let me see your research first.\n(Pete hands her a big binder filled with research.) \nMs. Weaver: That’s a heavy binder. And you and your Baby look great.\nPete: Thanks, Ms. Weaver. We feel great!\nMs. Weaver: Anna. Anna, you’re next. Anna? Anna wake up!\n(She wakes up but is very confused.) \nAnna: I'm here, Baby! I’m here! I’m here! Here's your bottle. \n(She accidentally squirts her bottle and milk goes everywhere.) \nMs. Weaver: Anna, you and your baby look awful. What happened?\nAnna: Well, I took her everywhere. Everywhere. And I fed her every three hours. So, I haven’t slept since … what day is it?\nMs. Weaver: It’s Friday. What happened there?\n(Ms. Weaver points to a large bandage on Anna’s flour baby.)\nAnna: Oh, that. Oh, that. I was making myself a salad and had a little accident with a knife. I put my flour baby in front of me. And then I accidentally stabbed it. But I gave it First Aid!\nMs. Weaver: Is that a burn?\nAnna: Yes. Yes it is. While I was making myself dinner, I put Baby next to me. I accidentally knocked her into the sink. So I put her in the microwave to dry. That’s when she caught fire.\n(Pete smiles, thinking he’s won.)\nProfessor Bot: Okay. So, we use a reflexive pronoun when it refers to the subject of a sentence or clause.\nBut we DON’T use a reflexive pronoun with prepositions of place.\nAnna uses examples of both in one sentence: While I was making myself dinner, I put Baby next to me.\nWe use a reflexive pronoun in the first part of the sentence. “Myself” refers to the subject “I.” \nBut in the second part of the sentence, we don’t use a reflexive pronoun in the prepositional phrase. We use the pronoun “me.” Why? “next to” is a preposition of place.\n(Back in the meeting room, we’re about to learn who won the parenting experiment. Pete is smiling, thinking he won.)\nMs. Weaver: Anna, Anna, you should be very proud of yourself.\nPete: Proud? She stabbed and burned her baby!! And she only did one page of research…and it’s covered in milk. Ew.\nMs. Weaver: Yes, Pete. But she followed instructions.\nPete: Hey, I did ...\nMs. Weaver: Please, Pete. Anna, I think your baby has lost some weight. Is there something else you want to share?\nAnna: Yes. I’d like to share … these! I made them myself this morning.\nPete: You baked your baby? You should be ashamed of yourself! \nAnna: I baked them at the end of the experiment, Pete. At that point, this was just a bag of flour.\nPete: It was always just a bag of flour!!\nMs. Weaver: Pete, will you listen to yourself?! You sound crazy.\nPete: I sound crazy! This whole experiment was crazy!! She was the one who carried around and fed it and ...\n(Anna puts a cookie into his mouth. He chews it and begins to smile.)\nPete: Mmm. That is good.\n(They all agree and eat the cookies.)\nProfessor Bot: So, what have we learned? We’ve learned when to use reflexive pronouns and when not to.\nGo to our website for more information! You can practice using reflexive pronouns in our comments section.\n \n\n\naccidentally – adj. happening in a way that is not planned or intended\nashamed – adj. feeling shame or guilt\nbake – v. to make food, such as bread and cake, by preparing a dough, batter, etc., and cooking it in an oven using dry heat\nbandage – n. a covering, such as a strip of cloth, that protects or supports part of the body that has been hurt\nbinder – n. a cover for holding together sheets of paper\nbottle – n. a glass or plastic container that has a narrow neck and usually has no handle\nburn – n. an injury caused by fire, heat or acid\nburn – v. to destroy or damage something by fire or heat\ncookie – n. a sweet baked food that is usually small, flat, and round and is made from flour and sugar\ndry – v. to remove water or moisture from something or someone\nFirst Aid – n. emergency treatment given to a sick or injured person\nknife – n. a usually sharp blade attached to a handle that is used for cutting\nknock – v. to touch or hit someone or something in a way that is not planned or intended\nmicrowave – n. an oven in which food is cooked or heated quickly by very short waves of electromagnetic energy\nsquirt – v. to suddenly force a liquid out through a small opening\nstab – v. to wound someone or something with a pointed object, such as a knife\n\n \n\nIn last week's lesson, Professor Bot taught you when to use reflexive pronouns. This week, he teaches you when not to use them. \nNow, you try it!\nUse the Comments section below and tell us about a time when you did something yourself, or a person or people you know did something by himself, herself or themselves.\nFor example:\nAfter the holiday dinner, I washed all of the dishes myself. (\"I\" is the subject and \"myself\" is the reflexive pronoun.)\nSubjects and their reflexive pronouns:\nI…myself\nYou…yourself\nHe…himself\nHer…herself\nOne…oneself\nIt…itself\nWe…ourselves\nYou…yourselves\nThey…themselves\nRemember, do NOT use reflexive pronouns:\nAfter prepositions of place:\nEx: I put Baby next to myself. (wrong) \n I put Baby next to me. (right) \nEx: I put my flour baby in front of myself (wrong)\nI put my flour baby in front of me. (right)\nAfter these verbs: meet, feel, relax, concentrate:\nEx: They will meet themselves at The Studio next Friday. (wrong)\n They will meet at The Studio next Friday. (right)\nAfter verbs that describe things we normally do for ourselves, such as dress, shave and wash​:\nEx: Anna got dressed herself for a day with her new flour baby. (wrong)\n Anna got dressed for a day with her new flour baby. (right)\n \n\nSee how well you understand this lesson by taking a listening quiz.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna loves movies! And Pete has invited her to see one with him. But is that a good idea?\n \n\n\n \nAnna: Hi, can you tell me how to get to your movie theater?\n(Movie theater worker on the phone gives directions.)\nAnna: Oh, that’s easy. OK, thank you. Bye.\n(Anna meets Pete outside of the theater.)\nAnna: Hi, Pete! Thanks for the movie invitation.\nPete: Yeah, sure Anna.\nAnna: I love movies. I love the plot! I love the set design! I love the costumes! I love -\nPete: Anna, I take movies very seriously. You're not one of those people who talks during a movie, are you?\nAnna: No.\nPete: Good.\nProfessor Bot: Anna loves movies. And..she loves talking about movies. And Pete doesn’t sound happy about that.\nBut he’s trying to be polite. He can do that with Indirect Questions.\nWe can ask a question directly: Where is your movie theater? or indirectly as Anna does:\nAnna: Can you tell me how to get to your movie theater?\nThey have the same meaning. But indirect questions are more polite and a little more formal.\nMany indirect questions begin with:\nCan/Could you tell me…\nWould/Do you mind…\nWould it be possible… \nor\nDo you know…\nHmm, do you know if Anna will stop talking? I sure don’t.\nKeep watching. And, this time look for indirect questions that begin with: Would you mind…\nAnna: I love the smell of popcorn. I love seats that rock. \n(Her chair makes noise as she rocks back and forth.)\nPete: I love when people are quiet.\n(The lights go down and we see movie light on their faces.)\nAnna: Ooh look, the previews are starting. I love to see what movies are coming out. Oh, this one looks good!\nPete: Anna, the previews are part of the movie experience. So, would you mind not talking?\nAnna: Oh, sure, sure.\n\n(Anna eats her popcorn loudly. Then, she begins drinking her milkshake loudly.)\nPete: Anna, I was wondering: are you almost finished with that?\nAnna: No. There's still a lot of milkshake at the bottom. \n(She drinks loudly again. And again.) \nPete: Anna, do you mind not drinking so loudly?\nAnna: I'll try. But it's really thick.\n(She moves the straw around and makes even more noise.) \nPete: Anna, what are you doing?! \n(A person in the audience shushes Pete.)\nPerson in audience: Shh!\n(Pete tells the person what was happening.) \nPete: I’m not the one making all the noise.\nPerson in audience: Shhh!\nAnna: I’m done now.\n(Anna now holds many noisy boxes of candy. Finally, she chooses a candy bar.) \nPete: Anna, would you mind opening that a little bit more quietly?\nAnna: I'll try. \n(She tries to open it quietly but cannot.) \nPete: Anna, just give it to me!\n(He tears it open with his mouth. It makes a loud noise. Again, someone in the audience thinks he is making too much noise.) \nPerson in audience: Shhh!\n\nPete: (to the person) It's not mine. I'm opening it for her. Here.\nPerson in audience: Shhhhhh!!\n(He gives the candy bar quickly back to her.)\nPete: Here!\nAnna: Thanks, Pete.\nPete: Now, would you mind being more quiet? \n(The light of someone’s phone shines in Pete’s face. He asks the person a question.) \nPete: Excuse me, would you mind turning down your phone light?\n(Then, Anna’s phone rings.) \nAnna: Oh, sorry! I forgot to turn my phone off.\n(She tries to turn it off but drops it under the seat.) \nAnna: Oh no! I dropped it. Where is it?\n(She looks under the seat in front of her.)\nPete: Anna, can you please turn off your phone?\n(She speaks to the person Pete just asked to turn their phone light down.) \nAnna: Excuse me, would you mind lending me your phone light for a minute?\nPete: No! I’ll get it! \nPerson in audience: Shhhhh!\n(People shush Pete again. He finally has had enough.)\nPete: Look, people, I’m not the noisy one here! So, you all need to shush the right person. And I should know about shushing! I shush people all the time!!\nSecurity guard: Excuse me, sir. You can’t yell in a movie theater. Would you mind coming with me?\nPete: You're kicking me out? Me? But I’m always the quiet one in the movie!\n(The security guard takes Pete out. Anna watches the movie and eats quietly from her bag of popcorn.) \nAnna: Pete should know better. You have to be quiet in a movie theater. Shh, the movie’s starting!\nProfessor Bot: Well, that’s a surprise! I thought Anna would be the noisy one.\nWell, she was … with her food. But Pete did all of the talking. At least he tried to be polite by using indirect questions. \n \n\n\ncandy bar – n. a long, thin, sweet food, usually covered in chocolate\ndirect – adj. connected or related to something in a clear way\nformal – adj. suitable for serious or official speech and writing\nindirect – adj. not direct\ninvitation – n. a written or spoken request for someone to go somewhere or to do something\nkick out – v. to force someone to leave a place\nlend – v. to give something to someone to be used for a period of time and then returned\nmilkshake – n. a thick drink made of milk, a flavoring syrup, and often ice cream\nplot – n. a series of events that form the story in a novel, movie, or live theater performance\npolite – adj. having or showing good manners or respect for other people\npopcorn – n. corn in the form of hard yellow seeds that burst open and become soft and white when they are heated\npreview – n. a selected group of scenes that are shown to advertise a movie or television show\nrock – v. to move someone or something back and forth or from side to side\nseat – n. something, such as chair, that you sit on\nset design – n. the creation of film, television or theatrical scenery.\nshush – v. to tell someone to be quiet using the interjection “shh”\nstraw – n. a thin tube used for sucking up a drink\ntake (something) seriously – expression. to treat someone or something as being very important and deserving attention or respect\nthick – adj. not flowing easily\nturn down – v. to lower the volume, temperature or channel of something by pressing a button or moving a switch\nturn off  – v. to stop the operation or flow of (something) by pressing a button, moving a switch, etc.\n \n\n\nNow, you try it!\nWhen you are in a new city or place, you may have many questions. For example, maybe you are visiting a museum, restaurant or some other place. You don't know how to find it. So, you ask someone a question. Then, when you arrive at the place, you have more questions.\nRead about indirect questions below. Then, use the Comments section to practice making indirect questions!\n \n\nDirect questions are questions that we can ask family, friends, or other people with whom we are close.\nEx: “Where is the movie theater?”\nIndirect questions are polite and a little more formal. We use them when we talk to strangers or people we are not close with and in work situations.\nEx: “Could you tell me where the movie theater is?”\nCommon indirect phrases:\nCan/Could you tell me…\nWould you mind…\nWould it be possible\nIs there any chance….\nDo you know…\nDo you have any idea...\nWord Order\nWhen we make indirect questions, the word order changes. Look carefully at the sentences below. \nDirect: Why didn’t Penelope come?\nIndirect: Can/could you tell me why Penelope didn’t come? \nWRONG: Can/could you tell me why didn’t Penelope come? \nDirect: Where is my phone?\nIndirect: Do you know where my phone is? \nWRONG: Do you know where is my phone? \nDirect: Where is he?\nIndirect: Would you mind telling me where he is? \nWRONG: Would you mind telling me where is he? \nUsing do/does/did\nFor direct questions with do, does or did, this word is removed from the noun clause in the indirect question. (The noun clause in the first example below is \"what time the meeting starts.\")\nDirect: What time does the meeting start?\nIndirect: Do you have any idea what time the meeting starts?\nWRONG: Do you have any idea what time does the meeting start? \nDirect: Where do you want to sit?\nIndirect: Can you tell me where you want to sit?\nWRONG: Can you tell me where do you want to sit? \nUsing can/could\nWith some direct questions that begin with can or could, this word is removed from the indirect question.\nDirect: Can/could I come to the movie?\nIndirect: Would it be possible for me to come to the movie? \nWRONG: Would it be possible can I come to the movie? \nDirect: Can/could you share your popcorn?\nIndirect: Would you mind sharing your popcorn? \nWRONG: Would you mind can you share your popcorn? \n“Yes or No” Questions \nA “yes or no” question is a question whose expected answer is “yes” or “no.”\nFor \"yes or no\" direct questions without what, where, why, who, when and how, we use if or whether in the indirect question.\nDirect: Does Anna take movies seriously?\nIndirect: Do you know if Anna takes movies seriously? \nIndirect: Do you know whether Anna takes movies seriously? \nWRONG: Do you know does Anna take movies seriously? \nDirect: Is this the right theater?\nIndirect: Can you tell me if this is the right theater? \nIndirect: Can you tell me whether this is the right theater? \nWRONG: Can you tell me is this the right theater? \nDirect: Has the movie ended?\nIndirect: Do you have any idea if the movie has ended? \nIndirect: Do you have any idea whether the movie has ended? \nWRONG: Do you have any idea has the movie ended? \n \n\nSee how well you understand this lesson by taking a listening quiz.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna, Penelope and Rick are making a news story about the Washington Car Show. Anna is having a lot of fun -- maybe too much fun...\n \n\n\n \nAnna: (to Penelope) That’s a great idea. (to Rick) Rick, I think we should use this as the opening shot.\nPenelope: Anna, did Ms. Weaver give us instructions for covering the car show?\nAnna: She did. She said that we need to show lots of cars. She said we need to interview people. And she also said that we should have fun.\nPenelope: Those were her exact words?\nAnna: Yeah. She said, “Have fun, Anna!” And she is the boss. \nAnna: (to Rick) Okay, Rick, are you - are you ready? OK. Hello, I'm Anna Matteo. Welcome to the Washington Car Show!\nAnna: People all over town are saying that if you like cars, this is the place to be! So, let's see what people are talking about. (at Rick) How was that? Okay? Is that Good?\nProfessor Bot: Anna, Penelope and Rick are making a news story about the Washington Car Show. Ms. Weaver gave them instructions.\nWe often need to tell others what someone else said.\nThere are two ways to do this. One is to use the person’s exact words and use quotation marks. We call this \"direct speech.\"\nFor example, Ms. Weaver had said, “You need to show lots of cars.”\nThe other way is to talk about what someone said. We call this \"reported speech.\"\nAnna tells Penelope: She said that we need to show lots of cars.\nIn this sentence, \"she,\" is the subject, “said” is the reporting verb, “that” is the conjunction and “we need to show lots of cars” is the reporting clause.\nKeep watching, and listen for sentences where Anna talks about what someone else said!\nAnna: This car show has many styles of vehicles. There are utility vehicles, classic cars, trucks, sports cars, and everyday vehicles.\nPenelope: Okay, I think we got good interviews.\nAnna: Me too! People had very different opinions. But they all said they loved cars.\nPenelope: Anna, look -- a robot!\nAnna: A robot!\nPenelope: A robot!\nAnna: Rick, we have to use the robot in the show!\n(They walk over to the robot. Anna begins to dance like a robot.)\nRobot: What is your first name?\nAnna: Anna! Anna!\nRobot: Anna, you know, what an effort. What an effort to robot dance. How about a round of applause for Anna! I’ve never seen anyone try so hard.\nAnna: Penelope, did you hear that? Hank the Robot said that he has never seen anyone dance like me.\nPenelope: Uh, I think many people here are saying that, Anna. \nAnna: That was fun. You know what someone told me? You can test drive a Jaguar at this car show.\nPenelope: Now, that sounds fun.\nAnna: Let’s go.\nPenelope: Okay.\nAnna: This course is smooth. So you can drive faster.\nAnna: He said...that I can’t drive, unfortunately.\n(They begin the test drive. Kurt, the stunt driver, does the driving.)\nAnna: Oh my gosh…reverse.\nAnna: That was great. This is awesome.\nKurt: Are you ready to go on the rollercoaster?\nAnna: I’m ready.\nKurt: Here we go!\nAnna: That’s awesome.\nAnna: That was...That was awesome! I just want to go one more time. I promise. That’s it. Just one more time.\nAnna: This course is bumpy and uneven. I was told that I could drive this course. So I am.\nAnna: (to Rick) Okay, Rick, are you rolling? Awesome. Okay, this course is uneven. But I think the ride will be smooth.\nAnna: Ooh. This hill is really steep.\nAnna: Oh my gosh. I can’t tell you how much fun this is.\nAnna: Penelope, that was so much fun! I think I need to go again.\nPenelope: Uh, Anna, I think we have enough test drive video.\nAnna: Ms. Weaver said to get a lot. So, I think I should go again. (to Rick) Rick, I’m going to go again. Until next time!\nPenelope: But I want to get lunch, Anna!\nProfessor Bot: Penelope said she wants to go to lunch. But I don’t think that’s going to happen soon.

First, read about reported speech below. Then try changing a few of these sentences into reported speech:\nAnna asked, \"Rick, are you ready?\"\nHank said, \"I've never seen anyone try so hard.\"\nKurt asked, \"Are you ready to go on the rollercoaster?\"\nAnna said, \"This hill is really steep.\"\nPenelope said, \"I think we have enough test drive video.\"\nAnna said, \"I think I should go again.\"\nWrite your sentences in the Comments section and we will try to respond to you.\n​\n\nWe often need to tell others what someone else said. We can do this in two ways. One is to say the person’s exact words and use quotation marks. We call this “direct speech.” The other is to talk about what someone else said. We call this “reported speech.”\n\nDirect Speech\n\nReported Speech\n\n“You need to show lots of cars.”\n\nShe said (that) we need show lots of cars.\n\n \nReported speech contains a subject, reporting verb, conjunction and reporting clause. (The word “that” is optional.)\n\nSubject noun or pronoun\n\nReporting Verb\n\nConjunction\n\nReporting Clause\n\nShe\n\nsaid\n\n(that)\n\nwe need to show lots of cars.\n\n \nUsing Reported Speech\nTo use reported speech, choose a reporting verb, such as say, tell or ask. Usually, the verb in direct speech moves one tense back in time in reported speech.\n\nDirect Speech\n\nReported Speech\n\n“I drive my car every day.”\n\nShe said (that) she drove her car every day.\n\n“I am driving my car.\n\nShe said (that) she was driving her car.\n\n“I have driven my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she had driven her car.\n\n“I will drive my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she would drive her car.\n\n \nIf the speaker is reporting something that was just said, the reporting clause is often in present tense. This is also common for general facts. \n\nDirect Speech\n\nReported Speech\n\n“You need to show lots of cars.”\n\nShe said (that) we need to show lots of cars.\n\n“The sky is blue.”\n\nShe said (that) the sky is blue.\n\n \nThe modals might, should, would, could and ought to do not change in reported speech. However, can, must and have to do change.\n\nDirect Speech\n\nReported Speech\n\n“I can/could drive my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she could drive her car.\n\n“I may/might drive my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she might drive her car.\n\n“I must drive my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she had to drive her car.\n\n“I have to drive my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she had to drive her car.\n\n“I should drive my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she should drive her car.\n\n“I ought to drive my car.”\n\nShe said (that) she ought to drive her car.\n\n \nChange the point of view. For example, the subject “I” becomes “he” or “she” and the subject “we” becomes “they.”\n\nDirect Speech\n\nReported Speech\n\n“I have two tickets to the Car Show.”\n\nHe said (that) he had two tickets to the Car Show.\n\n“We want to dance like Hank the Robot.”\n\nThey said (that) they wanted to dance like Hank the Robot.\n\n \nUse if or whether to report a “yes or no” question. And use the reporting verb “ask.”\n\nDirect Speech\n\nReported Speech\n\n“Do you like the Washington Car Show?”\n\nShe asked if/whether I liked the Washington Car Show.\n\n \n\nSee how well you understand this lesson by taking a listening quiz.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna wants to get Pete a gift for his birthday. So, she visits a store called Tanglewood Works and tries to learn the difference between trash and treasure...\n \n\n\nAnna: (on phone, to Pete) Got it. Pete, I promise. I won’t tell anyone. (to herself) Bye. He is so strange.\nAshley: Hey, Anna!\nAnna: Hi, Ashley!\nAshley: Are you talking to yourself again?\nAnna: No, not this time. I was talking to Pete.\nAshley: How’s he doing?\nAnna: Good. He has a birthday coming up! But he told me not to tell anyone.\nAshley: Why?\nAnna: Well, from the way he was speaking, I don’t think he likes cake or presents or fun.\nAshley: That sounds like Pete.\nAnna: Well, I don’t care. I’m getting him a present. Do you know where I can buy something unique?\nAshley: I do -- Tanglewood Works. You will definitely find something unique there.\nAnna: Great. I’ll go this weekend. Now, speaking of Pete’s birthday, what else should I do? I know. I’ll rent him a clown!\nAshley: Yeah, he’ll never speak to you again.\nProfessor Bot: Did you hear Ashley and Anna using the words talk and speak?\nTalk and speak both mean “to say words.” And, many times, you can use either word without losing any meaning. But there are some differences in when we use these words.\nThe word talk is usually used:\n\nfor conversations between two or more people\nand informal situations, such as between friends or family\n\nFor example, Ashley asks Anna: “Are you talking to yourself again?”\nSpeak is usually used:\n\nfor one-way communication, such as presentations\nformal situations, such as a boss speaking with her workers\nto talk about language ability\nand in polite requests\n\nKeep watching, and listen for the words talk and speak.\n(Anna goes to Tanglewood Works.)\nSue: Hey there. Welcome to Tanglewood Works! I’m Sue. How can I help you today?\nAnna: Hi Sue, I’m Anna. A friend told me about your store. She said, “Anna, this place is really unique!”\nSue: We are! Here at Tanglewood Works, we focus on things that are handmade, reclaimed and recycled.\nAnna: Wow! That is really good for the environment.\nSue: It’s good for you too. Local artists made all of these one-of-a-kind pieces. And I paint most of the furniture.\nAnna: Can I look around?\nSue: Oh, please do.\n(Anna walks around the store.)\nSue: So, Anna, do you like to make things?\nAnna: Me? Oh, no. Every time I try to make something, something goes wrong.\n(She knocks down many things.)\nAnna: Oh, sorry. Sorry.\nSue: It’s okay. Anna, everybody can make something.\nAnna: Sue, this piece is very interesting!\nSue: You know, when I found these pieces, they were broken and in a dumpster. But they spoke to me. And they said, “Save me, Sue! Save me!”\nAnna: Sue, what do you mean they “spoke” to you?\nSue: When I see something special that someone has thrown away, I can almost hear it talk.\nAnna: It’s not saying anything!\nSue: Anna, it’s not easy to see the treasure in trash.\nAnna: Or hear it talk. \nSue: But you can learn. In fact, I teach private classes. And one is called Turning Trash to Treasure.\nSue: Next week, bring in some trash and we’ll turn it into treasure. Just remember – pick some trash that “speaks” to you. \nAnna: Got it! I’ll see you next week!\nProfessor Bot: Will Anna find trash that “speaks” to her? What will it say?

    "dialog": "\n\nSue tries to teach Anna how to turn trash into treasure. But Anna doesn't seem to know what treasure is. And she makes a big mess.\n \n\n\nSue: Welcome to class, Anna. I can’t wait to see your trash!\nSue: Oh, okay. Alright, it’s a -- it’s a net with a … oh, it’s got a hole in it. Tell me about that.\nAnna: This net said to me, “Anna, I used to catch stuff. I don’t anymore. So, use me, Anna.” That’s what it said. It said, “Use me, Anna.”\nSue: Okay. So...it’s a plastic helmet.\nAnna: This plastic helmet said, “Anna. Hey, Anna, find me a head.”\nSue: Okay, um...and a broken toy.\nAnna: This broken toy … this broken toy said to me – it said, “Anna, help me find fun.” “Help me, Anna” is what it said.\nSue: Anna, this stuff is not saying anything to you or me or anyone. It’s what we like to call in the business … garbage.\nAnna: But you said to bring in trash.\nSue: Sometimes trash is treasure. Sometimes it's just trash.\nSue: Anna, don’t worry. Next week, I could teach you decoupage.\nAnna: Decoupage. Decoupage. That’s fun to say.\nSue: All you need to bring is a clean shoe box. A box that held shoes. \nAnna: I got it. I got it! See you next week!\nProf. Bot: Ut oh. It looks like Anna doesn’t know the difference between treasure and trash. She thinks those things are telling her something!\nProf. Bot: The words tell and say have similar meanings. But we use them in different ways.\nProf Bot: Tell means “to inform or instruct someone with words” and is almost always followed by an indirect object. For example, Sue says, “Tell me about that.”\nProf. Bot: The word me is the indirect object and tells us who is being told.\nProf. Bot: Say means “to express something with words” and focuses more on the words used. For example, Anna says, “That’s what it said. It said, ‘Use me, Anna.’”\nProf. Bot: Listen for when Anna and Sue use tell and say.\nSue: Anna, welcome to Decoupage class. Decoupage is just gluing pretty pictures onto stuff.\n(Sue gets a phone call.) \nSue: Anna, I’ve got to talk to this person. I’ll be right back. Don’t start without me.\nAnna: Got it.\n(Sue leaves to take her phone call. Anna gets glue everywhere. She becomes covered with glue and paper.) \nAnna: Okay. I can fix this.\nSue: Anna, what happened? I told you to wait for me!\nAnna: Actually, you told me not to start without you, which I didn’t. Your glue is really sticky.\nSue: Next week, let’s try lamp making. There’s – there’s no glue. Here's a flier. \nAnna: Thanks. See you next week.\nSue: Anna, you did really well this week. I think lamp making might be your thing!\nAnna: Thanks, Sue. I did everything you told me to do.\nSue: Remember: I said to read the instructions really carefully. Where are those instructions?\nAnna: Let’s just plug it in!\n(Anna plugs in the lamp and, suddenly, the city loses electricity.)\nAnna: So, what class will you be teaching next week?\nProf. Bot: Too bad Anna didn’t follow instructions! Visit our website for more on tell and say!\n \n\n\n\nactually – adv. used to stress that a statement is true especially when it differs in some way from what might have been thought or expected\ncommand – n. an order given to a person to do something\ndecoupage – n. the art of decorating an object by gluing pictures onto it\nelectricity – n. a form of energy that is carried through wires and is used to operate machines, lights, etc.\nflier – n. a piece of paper that has something printed on it, such as an advertisement\nfocus – v. to direct your attention or effort at something specific\ngarbage – n. things that are no longer useful or wanted and that have been thrown out \nglue – n. substance used to stick things tightly together\nhelmet – n. a hard hat that is worn to protect your head\nhole - n. an opening in or through something \nnet – n. a device that is used for catching or holding things or \npaper – n. the material that is used in the form of thin sheets for writing or printing on, wrapping things, etc.\npicture – n. a painting, drawing, or photograph of someone or something\nplastic – n. a light, strong substance that can be made into different shapes and that is used for making many common products\nplug – n. a part at the end of an electric cord that has two or three metal pins that connect the cord to a source of electricity\nsticky – adj. covered in a substance that things stick to\nstuff – n. materials, supplies, or equipment\nthing – n. an object whose name is not known or stated\n \n\n\nNow, you try it!\nFirst, read more about tell and say below. Then, practice using those words in the Comments section. Write about what happens in Lesson 22! You can find some examples below. Try making at least one sentence with tell and one with say. \n\n\n \n\nTELL means “to inform or instruct someone with words.” We use an indirect object (personal pronoun) with tell to say who is receiving the information.\nTell is only used without an indirect object in a few expressions, such as: tell the time, tell the difference and tell the truth.\nWhen we report a command or instruction, we usually also use the verb tell. When we do this, we use an infinitive verb after the indirect object. \n\nCommand (in Direct Speech)\n\nReported Speech\n\n“Read the instructions carefully.”\n\nShe told Anna to read the instructions carefully.\n\nUse tell:\n\nIn reported speech\nSometimes in direct speech*\nWith a personal pronoun\n\nExamples:\n\nSue told Anna that she liked her lamp.\nShe told her to read the instructions carefully.\nAnna told her that the broken toys wanted help.\nSue told me, “So…it’s a plastic helmet.” (wrong)\n\nSAY means \"to express something with words.\" When we use say, we do not focus on who is receiving the information. So, we do not use an indirect object (personal pronoun).\nUse say:\n\nIn direct speech\nIn reported speech\nWithout a personal pronoun\n\nExamples:\n\nAnna said the glue was very sticky.\nSue said that she had to take a call.\nShe said, “Don’t start without me.”\nAnna said me, “Got it.” (wrong)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSue tells Anna not to start without her.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Use\n\nTell\n\nSay\n\nIn reported speech\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nIn direct speech\n\nLess common\n\nYes\n\nWith an indirect object\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n \n*The verb Tell is sometimes used with direct speech, but this is less common than say. However, it can be common in some types of writing, such as in news reports.\n \n\nHow well do you know the grammar from Level 2? Test yourself!\nIn Lesson 22, you will see examples of reported speech and other grammar that you have learned in Level 2. Look for sentences in Lesson 22 with:\n\nReported speech\nPast habitual \nPrepositions\nPassive voice\n\nThen, write those sentences in the Comments section. For example: But you said to bring in trash (reported speech).\n \n\nSee how well you understand this lesson by taking a listening quiz.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna interviews musician Emma G on her show. But, her excitement starts to become a little....strange. \n \n\n\n \nAnna: Hello?\nMs. Weaver: Anna, this is Ms. Weaver.\nAnna: Ms. Weaver!\nMs. Weaver: Tomorrow, you’ll be interviewing musician Emma G.\n(Anna is very excited. She loves Emma G’s music.)\nAnna: Emma G?! I will be talking to Emma G?!\nMs. Weaver: Anna? Anna, are you there?\nProfessor Bot: Anna and Ms. Weaver used the future continuous verb tense to talk about the interview.\nProf. Bot: We use future continuous to talk about actions that will be in progress at or around a time in the future.\nProf. Bot: For example, Ms. Weaver says, “Tomorrow, you’ll be interviewing musician Emma G.”\nProf. Bot: There are two options for future continuous. The first is: will be + the -ing form of the verb\nProf. Bot: And the second is: be + going to be + the -ing form of the verb. Keep watching for more!\nAnna: Hello and welcome to The Music! Today, musician Emma G will be joining us here!\nAnna: She is a wonderful songwriter and an amazing singer. And I love her! Let’s give a warm welcome to Emma G!\nAnna: Hi. Thank you for coming on the show, Emma G.\nEmma G: Of course. It’s great to be here.\nAnna: Well, we can’t wait to hear you sing. I listen to your music a lot. So, I feel like I know you. Is that strange?\nEmma G: Anna, listening to music can be a very personal experience. So, no, that’s not strange.\nAnna: Good because I made something for you -- a video scrapbook of our friendship.\nAnna: I took photos of you and added myself. I worked on it all weekend.\nEmma G: Well, that -- that’s strange. Is that even -- is that even legal?\nAnna: Now, Emma, let’s talk about your schedule. Tell me ... I mean, tell us exactly where you will be and when. Exactly.\nEmma G: Sure. Well, in early June, I’ll be performing at several venues across Austin, Texas.\nAnna: That’s my vacation week. I can meet you there! We can tour the city. We can have lunch.\nEmma G: Um, yeah maybe. Then in mid-July, I’m going to be teaching at a music camp in Chicago.\nAnna: I’ll be visiting my sister then. She only lives about six hours from Chicago! I could drive over. We could hang out.\nEmma G: Yeah, uh maybe. You know, maybe now is a good time for some music.\nAnna: That’s a great idea. Now, let's hear a song from Emma G.!\nEmma G: I wrote this song a couple of years ago. It’s called “Wary.”\nEmma G: Do you believe in happy endings?\nAnna: Endings...\nEmma G: Do you really believe that we could be…\nAnna: Be...\nEmma G: I think something is wrong. I hear a voice in the background.\nAnna: Sorry. Sorry, Emma. That was me. I’m just so excited.\nEmma G: No problem. I'm glad you like the song.\nAnna: You go ahead. You go ahead.\nEmma G: Okay. Do you believe in happy endings?\n(She hears a tambourine playing and looks at Anna.)\nEmma G: Anna, there’s no tambourine in this.\nAnna: I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, Emma. See, I’ve always wanted to sing with you.\nEmma G: Well, come on over then and we can sing a song together first.\nAnna: No, I couldn't.\nEmma G: Come on. It’ll be fun.\nAnna: Okay! Here. I brought my favorite song.\nEmma G: Oh, uh okay. Actually, I like this song. Um, are you ready?\nAnna: Yes! Yes!\nEmma G: Okay.\nEmma G / Anna together:\nEvery breath you take*\nEvery move you make\nEvery bond you break\nEvery step you take\nI'll be watching you …\nI’ll be watching you...\nI’ll be watching you...\n*From \"Every Breath You Take\" by The Police\n \n\nAnd now, here's a song by Emma G called \"Just Drive.\" Click here to read the words.

Then, write two or three sentences in the Comments section about your future plans.\nBe sure to use future continuous in each sentence!\n\n\n \n\nWe use the future continuous verb tense for future actions that will continue for a period of time.\nFuture continuous is used only for action verbs. An action verb is a verb that expresses a physical or mental action. Examples are: write, read, sing, work, think and stop. Verbs like be, become, feel and look are not action verbs. \nFuture continuous:\n\nfor action verbs only\nhas two forms\n\nForms:\n\nwill be + ing verb\nbe + going to be + ing verb\n\nExamples:\n\nToday, musician Emma G will be joining us here!\nIn early June, I’ll be performing at several venues across Austin, Texas.\nAre you going to be teaching at the music camp in Chicago this July?\nShe won't be returning to Washington, DC until the end of the summer.\nI will be becoming happy when you visit my show tomorrow. (wrong)\n\nWith the future continuous, we often shorten the part of verb that comes after the subject. Look at the examples (You'll, I'll, I'm). \n\nsubject\n\nwill be\n\n-ing verb \n\nYou\n\n 'll be\n\ninterviewing\n\nEmma G.\n\n will be\n\njoining\n\n I\n\n 'll be\n\nperforming\n\n \nIn the second form of the future continuous verb tense, the verb to be is conjugated -- it changes to match the subject. See the examples below.\n\nsubject\n\nto be (conjugated)\n\ngoing to be\n\n-ing verb\n\n I\n\n 'm\n\ngoing to be\n\nteaching\n\nThey\n\n are\n\ngoing to be\n\nsinging\n\n\n\nHow well do you know the grammar from Level 2?

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna gets hit by lightning and, suddenly, can do amazing things. Or can she?\n \n\n\n \nANNA: Hi! I see you like superhero culture. Me too.\nANNA: In fact, tonight I’m going to the big superhero convention. Are you going?\nYOUNG MAN: Um, I don’t know.\nANNA: Well, you'd better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.\nANNA: So, since we’re talking about superheroes: would you rather become a superhero by accident, like Spiderman, or be born a superhero, like Wonder Woman?\nANNA: Take your time. It’s a big question. I thought about it for days –\nYOUNG MAN: Okay. If I had to choose, I’d rather be born a superhero.\nANNA: I’d rather become a superhero by an unexpected accident!\nYOUNG MAN: Aren’t all accidents unexpected?\nANNA: Well, yeah.\nYOUNG MAN: What was that!? Are you okay?\nANNA: I'm better than okay. I feel super!\nPROF. BOT: Oh No! Anna was just hit by lightning. She had better get help.\nPROF. BOT: We use had better to give advice. It is very informal and stronger than should and ought to. For example, Anna says: “You'd better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.” \nPROF. BOT: When we use had better, we usually shorten the word had for personal pronouns.\nPROF. BOT: We use would rather to say what we or someone else prefers to do or have. For example, the boy says: “Okay. If I had to choose, I’d rather be born a superhero.\nPROF. BOT: With would rather, we also shorten the word would when used with personal pronouns. Keep watching and listen for had better and would rather.\nYOUNG MAN: You’d better see a doctor.\nANNA: I’ve never felt better!\nYOUNG MAN: You were just struck by lightning!! And what happened to your hair and your clothes?\nANNA: I don't know. Wait, I do know. This is my super suit! And this is my origin story.\nYOUNG MAN: What are you talking about?\nANNA: An origin story tells the beginning of a superhero. You should know that.\nYOUNG MAN: You're not making any sense, lady. \nANNA: I would rather be called Lightning Bolt Lady! It’ll sound great in a theme song: Lightning Bolt Lady!\nANNA: Now, I need to find my superpowers --\nYOUNG MAN: Um, I really think --\nANNA: Wait. Don’t tell me. I’ll read your mind. You are thinking you’d like to be my super helper.\nYOUNG MAN: I was not thinking that.\nANNA: ... that you’d like to live in a treehouse.\nYOUNG MAN: No.\nANNA: … that you should eat more vegetables.\nYOUNG MAN: Please, stop talking. You really should get some help.\nANNA: Mind reading is not my superpower. Maybe I can become invisible. I … am … invisible!\nANNA: You can’t see me. Who am I? I’m not here. You can’t see me.\nYOUNG MAN: I can see you and so can everybody else.\nANNA: No power of invisibility. Maybe I can create a force field. I feel it working. Nothing can hurt –\n(Someone throws a piece of paper and it hits her head.)\nANNA: Ow, that wasn’t very nice. I see I have a lot of work to do. Well, goodbye, non-super person!\nYOUNG MAN: Wait. I’d better go with you. You might get worse…if that’s even possible.\nANNA: That's very nice of you, ordinary human. But I’d rather go by myself. This is a quest.\nYOUNG MAN: Every time you speak, I get more confused.\nANNA: A quest is a part of all superhero stories. You really need to work on your superhero studies. Now, stand back. I’ve never flown before.\nYOUNG MAN: And you’re not flying now.\nANNA: Flying is also not my superpower. That’s too bad. It's going to be expensive to Uber everywhere. You know, I'd rather walk. It’s a nice day. Goodbye, non-super person.\nYOUNG MAN: I am not talking to strangers again.\nANNOUNCER: Will Lightning Bolt Lady find her superpowers … ever? Ouch! Did that brick wall hurt? Will the young man ever talk to a stranger again?\nANNOUNCER: Find out on the next episode of Let’s Learn English!\n​\n\n\n\nannouncer – n. a person who gives information on television or radio\nbecome – v. to begin to be or come to be something\nbrick – n. a small, hard block of baked clay that is used to build structures, such as houses, and sometimes to make streets\nby accident – expression. in a way that is not planned or intended\ncreate -- v. to make or produce something\nconvention – n. a large meeting of people who come to a place for usually several days to talk about their shared work or other interests\nconsequence – n. something that happens as a result of a particular action or set of conditions\ndecide – v. to make a choice about something\nforce field – n. an invisible or transparent shield of energy that some superheroes produce as a form of protection\nhuman – n. a person\ninvisible – adj. impossible to see\nlightning – n. the flashes of light that are produced in the sky during a storm\norigin story – n. a story that informs the identity and motivations of heroes and villains in a comic book\nprefer – v. to like someone or something better than someone or something else\npower – n. physical force or strength\nquest – n. a journey made in search of something\nstand – v. to be in an upright position with all of your weight on your feet\nsuperhero – n. a fictional character who has amazing powers, such as the ability to fly\nsuperpower -- n. a special power that only superheroes have\nsuper suit – n. the special clothing that a superhero wears\ntheme song - a piece of music from a television program or film that is remembered as the music that represents that program or film\nUber – v. to ride in an Uber car\nunexpected – adj. not expected\nurgency – n. something that is very important and needs immediate attention\nwall – n. the structure that forms the side of a room or building\n \n\n\nNow, you try it!\nFirst, read about had better and would rather below. Then, write one sentences using each.\n\nUse had better to give Anna advice about being a superhero\nUse would rather to tell us what superpowers you prefer\n\nFor example, \"I would rather be able to fly than make a force field.\"\n \n\nWe use the modal had better to give advice and would rather to tell someone about preferences. \nWhen you see a pronoun with 'd after it, the 'd can be short for either had or would. For example, sometimes I'd means I had. Other times, I'd it means I would. Read more below.\n\nHad Better \nWe use had better to give advice. It is stronger than should and ought to. It tells us that there may be consequences if a person doesn’t take the advice.\nExamples:\nYou had better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.\n(Consequence: The conference might sell out.)\nAnna had better be careful with her superpowers!\n(Consequence: Someone could get hurt.)\n\nThe verb form is always had (not have) and we use a simple verb after had better. We also usually shorten had with personal pronouns:\nI’d / you'd / he'd / she'd / we'd / they'd better…\n\n subject\n\n had better\n\n simple verb\n\n I\n\n ‘d better\n\n go\n\n You\n\n ‘d better\n\n see\n\n \nSometimes, we use had better to show urgency. This is a more polite way to use it.\nExamples:\nI’d better go with you.

    "dialog": "\n\nLightning Bolt Lady goes looking for her superpowers. But will she ever find them? And will she ever help...anyone?\n \n\n\nANNOUNCER: When last we saw Anna, she had made a new friend. And they had been talking about superheroes for a while when suddenly Anna became Lightning Bolt Lady! \nANNOUNCER: She tried to find her superpowers. But it did not go well.\nANNOUNCER: She can’t fly, become invisible or create a force field. And she really cannot walk through walls. Ouch, Lightning Bolt Lady.\nANNOUNCER: She had been walking into that wall for about 15 minutes when she had a great idea.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: I just had a great idea!\nANNOUNCER: I can’t wait to hear this one! But first, let’s talk about grammar.\nANNOUNCER: Professor Bot is on vacation this week. I’m the announcer. So, I’m going to tell you about the past perfect continuous.\nANNOUNCER: We use this verb tense to show that an action started in the past and continued to another time or action in the past.\nANNOUNCER: For example, I said, “She had been walking into that wall for about 15 minutes when she had a great idea.”\nANNOUNCER: Had been walking is the past perfect continuous of the verb walk. It’s had been plus the -ing form of the verb.\nANNOUNCER: You’ll hear me use this verb tense a few more times today.\nANNOUNCER: Now, what am I forgetting? Oh right! Lightning Bolt Lady’s great idea.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: If I want to know my superpowers, I’ll need to learn about lightning!\nANNOUNCER: So, she read many books about lightning.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Wow. A lightning strike usually lasts less than a second.\n(She tells this to a person and he slowly moves away.)\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Lightning is really fast and I like speed walking. So, maybe one of my superpowers is super-speed walking! (to stranger) Bye!\n(She begins to super-speed walk.)\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Check! Super-speed walking is definitely one of my superpowers.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Lightning has millions of volts of electricity. Amazing!\n(She puts her hand up and lightning bolts shoot from her fingers.)\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Wow! I can charge a lot of batteries with this superpower!\nANNOUNCER: She had been looking for hours for someone to help when she found her chance.\nWOMAN: Hello? Hello? I’m sorry. I’m going to have to call you back. My phone is dying.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Excuse me, I can charge your phone.\nWOMAN: Really? Thanks!\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: I’m Lightning Bolt Lady!\n(She takes the woman's phone and shoots it with a lightning bolt. But it turns into ashes. Then, she gives the woman lots of money and smiles and says goodbye.)\n \nANNOUNCER: She had been practicing her superpowers all day. Suddenly, she heard a terrible sound – a child’s disappointment.\nANNOUNCER: These children tried to light a fire for over an hour. But then, they gave up.\nPARENT: Hey kids, that wood will never burn. It’is too wet.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Small humans, what is wrong?\nCHILD: Stranger danger!\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: I’m Lightning Bolt Lady!\nYOUNG MAN: Oh no. It’s you.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: (to YOUNG MAN:) We meet again. And guess what: I found my superpowers.\nCHILD: Well, we need a fire to toast the marshmallows to make S’mores.\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: I can help.\nYOUNG MAN: We don’t need a super-speed walker but thanks!\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Super-speed walking is just one of my superpowers. I can also do this!\n(She tries to use her lightning bolts but it doesn't go well.)\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Sorry! Let me do it again. \n(She lights the fire with her lightning bolts.)\nCHILDREN: Thanks, Lightning Bolt Lady!\nYOUNG MAN: Lightning Bolt Lady\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: You’re welcome. But you don’t have enough firewood. Using my super-speed walking, I will get more.\n(She super-speed walks around to get firewood.)\nPARENT: Lightning Bolt Lady, come back! A lightning storm is coming!\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Not a chance! There’s not a cloud in the …\nCHILD: Lightning Bolt Lady, are you okay?\nCHILD: Where's your super-suit?\nANNA: Oh no! I've lost my superpowers!\nYOUNG MAN: It's starting to rain. Do you want to go inside and eat some S’mores?\nANNA: You read my mind.\nANNA: You know, I thought mind reading would be one of my superpowers. But it wasn’t.\nCHILD: That’d be a cool superpower. But I’d rather be able to talk to animals.\nCHILD: That would be a cool superpower.\n \n\n\n\nash – n. the soft gray powder that remains after something, such as wood, has been completely burned and destroyed by fire\naverage – adj. a number that is calculated by adding quantities together and then dividing the total by the number of quantities\nbattery – n. a device that is placed inside a machine (such as a clock, toy, or car) to supply it with electricity\ncause – v. something or someone that makes something happen or exist\ncharge – v. to give an amount of electricity to something\ncloud – n. a white or gray mass in the sky that is made of many very small drops of water\ndefinitely – adv. without doubt\ndisappointment – n. the state of feeling of being disappointed\nfirewood – n. wood used to make fire\ngive up – phrasal verb. to stop an activity or effort\nmarshmallow -- a soft, white, sweet food made of sugar and eggs\nmillion – n. the number 1,000,000\nnot a chance – expression. there is no possibility\nsecond – n. a unit of time that is equal to ¹/₆₀ of a minute\ns’mores – n. a sweet snack consisting of a chocolate bar and toasted marshmallows sandwiched between graham crackers\nstrike – n. the act of hitting something with force\nterrible – adj. very shocking and upsetting\nvolt – n. a unit for measuring the force of an electrical current\n \n\n\nNow, you try it!\nFirst, read about the past perfect continuous verb tense below.

Test yourself!\nIn Lesson 25, you will see examples of grammar that you have learned in Level 2. Look for sentences in Lesson 25 with:\n\nPast perfect\nConditionals\nAdverb Clauses\nPrepositions\nPassive voice\nOther grammar you've learned in Level 2 \n\nThen, write those sentences in the Comments section. For example: She had been walking into that wall for about 15 minutes when she had a great idea.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna learns that someone at work looks a lot like her. But, who is this person? And what happens when they finally meet?\n \n\n\n \nANNA: This article is so interesting. Pete, listen to this: “Somewhere in the world there is someone who looks just like you.”\nPETE: No one is this handsome.\nANNA: Oh Pete, there's something between your teeth.\n(Pete tries to clean his teeth.)\nPETE: It is gone?\nANNA: No. No. It’s still there. There. You got it. But think of it: There could be two of us in the world!\nPETE: Two Annas?\nPROF. BOT: Two Annas? Today, we’re reviewing ways to describe and compare people. Keep watching for descriptions of people!\nPETE: Actually, Anna, maybe your silly article is right. Yesterday at work, I met a woman who looks just like you.\nANNA: Really? Wait, are you making fun of me?\nPETE: Not this time.\nPETE: She’s tall and has curly hair. But even her face looks like yours. I think she’s a career consultant.\nANNA: I bet she has a lot of great advice. I can’t wait to meet her.\nPETE: Yes, you can. I met her and she is very difficult.\nANNA: Pete, she’s just new. We have to give her a chance. What’s her name?\nPETE: Evelyna or something like that. You can’t miss her. She always wears a hat.\nPENELOPE: So, Anna, have you met the new consultant yet?\nANNA: No. But I’ve already heard. We look alike, don’t we?\nPENELOPE: Yeah, but you don’t act alike. You’re much nicer than she is.\nANNA: Maybe she gets nervous at new jobs. Or maybe she's shy. Let’s not judge, Penelope.\nPENELOPE: She’s not nervous or shy. She’s mean.\nANNA: You know, we should get to know her better. Let’s invite her to lunch!\nPENELOPE: Sorry but I’m busy that day.\n(Penelope walks away. Anna yells after her.)\nANNA: Oh, that’s too bad. Hey, I haven’t picked a day yet!\nPROF. BOT: So, did you find anything? Here are a few things I found: Anna uses the words “look alike” to talk about the new consultant. She says, “We look alike, don’t we?”\nPROF. BOT: Penelope uses “than” and the comparative adjective “nicer” to compare Anna with the new consultant. She says, “You’re much nicer than she is.” Keep watching for more!\n(Anna and Pete are playing a game.)\nANNA: This is going to be so much fun. Boy, I can't wait to play this game. \nEVILANA: How much longer are you going to be?\nANNA: We’ll be just a minute …\n(Anna turns around and sees her look-alike.)\n\nANNA: You must be Evelana. I’m Anna. We are look-alikes!\nEVILANA: No, we’re not. And my name is pronounced “Evil-ana.”\nPETE: Oh. This is going to be fun.\nEVILANA: You had better hurry up. I need this room for a lecture. It’s called: \"If You Want to Win, Others Must Lose.\" What is all this stuff, anyway?\nANNA: It’s a game. We’re going to play at lunch. \nEVILANA: It’s a stupid child's game!\nANNA: It's a fun game. But yes, it is for children.\nEVILANA: Well, you may be childish but I’m not. And you look stupid with that thing on your head.\nANNA: Well, you look serious with that look on your face. Come on, Pete. Let’s play somewhere else.\nPETE: Actually, I’m going to stay for Evilana’s lecture. \nANNA: Fine. You can learn new ways to beat people.\nEVILANA: He will. He will.\n(Days later, Anna and Penelope are playing the game. Pete comes in. He has a problem with his eye.)\nANNA: Okay. Am I a food?\nPENELOPE: Nope.\nPETE: Hey, do you guys have room for one more?\nPENELOPE: Sure, Pete! Come on over. What happened to your eye?\nPETE: Evilana “accidentally” hit me. And she didn’t even say sorry. She’s so mean!\nPENELOPE: I told you so.\nANNA: Here, Pete. Put on this headband. You’ll feel better. Penelope, you’re right. Evilana is an awful person!\n\nPENELOPE: And violent. And now we have to work with her!\nANNA: Haven’t you heard? She’s gone!

We moved from a 3-story house to a boat! So, we really had to downsize!\nANNA: I’d have to get rid of a lot of stuff.

It was a boat that turned into a bus.\nFANNY: Yeah, I don’t think that counts.\nANNA: Fanny, does this rocking ever bother you?\nFANNY: No, I love it.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna looks for birds but finds ice cream trucks. And then she finds...a spy? But, what is he hiding?\n\n\n\n \nKELLY: Oh, Anna, there you are! I am so glad we joined the Great City Bird Count! Aren't you?\nANNA: No. Today has been a bust … a flop … a bummer!\nKELLY: I’m sensing a little disappointment.\nANNA: A little?\nKELLY: My official bird-watching form is almost full!\nANNA: I've only seen pigeons ... lots and lots of pigeons! But I did write down some other valuable information.\nKELLY: Did you find a bird's nest?! \nANNA: No.\n(She shows Kelly a map of ice cream trucks.)\nANNA: I found 10 ice cream trucks in this five-block area.​ Their music seems to follow me everywhere.\nKELLY: We're supposed to be counting birds, not ice cream trucks. This is important scientific work!\nANNA: Well, when you want ice cream, my data will be pretty important.\nKELLY: Anna, birds are everywhere! I’m sure you’ll find something. Use your imagination! But, make sure that you put it on the official form.\n(Anna walks away with her ice cream truck map.)\nPROF. BOT: Anna was supposed to find birds, but she didn’t.\nPROF. BOT: Kelly says, “We're supposed to be counting birds, not ice cream trucks.” To be supposed to means you are expected to do something.\nPROF. BOT: It’s different from have to and ought to. Have to means you must do something. And ought to means you should do it but you don’t have to.\nPROF. BOT: Keep watching for have to and ought to!\n(Anna looks through binoculars but doesn't see birds. She talks to herself.) \nANNA: No birds. Oh wait, there’s another ice cream truck! Anna, focus on birds. Aw, but that truck has my favorite flavor ... banana! \nANNA: That man is in the way. I can’t see the price. I wonder what flavor he's getting.\nANNA: Strawberry? He doesn't seem like a strawberry kind of guy.\nANNA: In fact, he doesn't seem like an ice cream truck kind of guy. That suit looks expensive.\nANNA: Maybe he's a spy! You know what that means: The ice cream truck driver is a spy, too!\nANNA: Genius! It’s a perfect disguise.\nANNA: What?! The man in the suit left his briefcase at the ice cream truck!\nANNA: I was right! He is a spy! And, he just dropped off top-secret information! I ought to do something. Something needs to be done! I need to do something.\n(Anna runs to the ice cream truck and takes the briefcase.)\nANNA: I did it! I took the spy’s briefcase!\nANNA: What’s that?! The ice cream truck -- it’s following me! It wants the case back! I have to hide. \n(She runs and hides behind a tree.)\nANNA: This is my life now -- running, scared, alone.\n(She runs to another tree.)\nANNA: That awful music -- it’s following me everywhere!\n(The man sees her at the tree.)\nMAN: Hey! You found my briefcase.\nANNA: You caught me! I mean, I caught you!\nMAN: Well, I just want my briefcase. All my poems are in there.\nANNA: Poems? You’re a poet?\nMAN: Well, I'm a lawyer. But I write poems, too.\n(Anna gives the man his briefcase.)\nANNA: So, you’re not a spy?\nMAN: You look disappointed.\nANNA: No, that’s okay. It’s not your fault. Poems are nice, too. I guess.\nMAN: Well, would you like me to read my latest one?\nANNA: Why not?\nMAN: On sunny day walks, my hand reaches for ice cream from fragaria.\nANNA: I love your poem!\nMAN: I love ice cream.\nANNA: Me too.\nMAN: What's your favorite flavor?\nANNA: Banana.\nMAN: Well, my favorite flavor is ...\nANNA: Strawberry!\nMAN: How did you know that?\nANNA: A little bird told me.\n \n​\n\nbinoculars – n. a device that you hold up to your eyes and look through to see things that are far away\nbird – n. an animal that has wings and is covered with feathers\nblock – n. an area of land surrounded by four streets in a city\nbriefcase – n. a flat case that is used for carrying papers or books\ndata – n. facts or information used usually to calculate, analyze, or plan something\ndisguise – n. made to look like something else\ndrop off – phrasal verb. to take someone or something to a place and then leave​\nfragaria – n. a flowering plant that bears strawberries\ngenius – adj. in a way that uses remarkable talent or intelligence\nguy – n. a man (informal)\nimagination – n. the ability to form a picture in your mind of something that you have not seen or experienced\nin the way – expression. making it more difficult for a person to do something\nlawyer – n. a person whose job is to guide and assist people in matters relating to the law\nA little bird told me – expression. a way of saying that you do not want to reveal who told you something.\nnest – n. the place where a bird lays its eggs and takes care of its young\nofficial – adj. permitted, accepted, or approved by a person or organization that has authority\npigeon – n. a gray bird that is common in cities and that has a fat body and short legs\nprice – n. the amount of money that you pay for something or that something costs​\nreach – v. to be able to touch, pick up, or grab something by moving or stretching​\nsense – v. to understand or be aware of (something) without being told about it or having evidence that it is true\nstrawberry – n. a soft, juicy red fruit that grows on a low plant with white flowers\ntop-secret – adj. kept completely secret by high government officials\nvaluable – adj. very useful or helpful\nWhy not? – expression. used to make a suggestion, or agree to a suggestion \n \n\n\nIn past Let's Learn English lessons, you learned about the modal verbs have to and ought to. Today, you learned be supposed to. English learners sometimes confuse them:\nBe supposed to means to be expected to do something. But, sometimes we use it to say what someone is allowed to do.\nExamples:\n\n“We're supposed to be counting birds, not ice cream trucks.” -Kelly\nI am supposed to meet someone for lunch at noon.\nThey were not supposed to stay in the store after it closed.\n\nHave to has the same meaning as must. In American English, have to is much more common than must.\nExamples:\n\n“I have to hide!” -Anna\nWe have to leave by 9am to catch the tour.\nWhat time do you have to be at work?\n\nOught to has the same meaning as should. But, it is less common and more formal. Sometimes, it is used for saying what is probable.\nExamples:\n\n“I ought to hide!” -Anna\nYou ought to visit us for the holiday.\nThe show ought to be done in an hour.\n\n \n\n Modal \n\n Form\n\n be supposed to\n\n am/is/are/was/were + supposed to\n+ simple verb\n\n have to\n\n have to + simple verb\n\n ought to\n\n ought to + simple verb\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIn friendly situations, we sometimes use informal language to show disappointment. \nFor example, Anna says, \"Today has been a bust...a flop...a bummer!\"\nBust, flop, and bummer are three informal words that show disappointment. Bust and flop mean a complete failure. A bummer is something unpleasant or disappointing.\nExamples:\n\nI lost my phone. What a bummer!\nLast night's event was a real bust.\nThe film was so boring. It was a flop.\n\nSometimes, we can tell a person nicely that they did not cause the disappointment. \nFor example, Anna learns that the man with the briefcase is not a spy. She is disappointed, but says: \"No, that’s okay. It’s not your fault.\"\n\n\nNow, you try it!\n1. Write about something that should or must happen soon in your life or in your city or town. Use be supposed to, have to and ought to. \n2. What is something that you or someone else has felt disappointed about? Write a few sentences about it. Use language from today's lesson to show disappointment. \nOr, just tell us what you think of the lesson. We'd love to hear from you! Write to us in the comments section below.\n\n\nIn today's lesson, you saw examples of grammar from past lessons. Look for sentences in Lesson 28 with: \n\npassive voice\npresent perfect\nadverb clauses\nthe verb tell\n\nWrite your findings in the comments section.\n\n\nSee how well you understand this lesson by taking a listening quiz.

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna becomes a fire safety monitor. But will she do a good job? And when will she use her skills?\n\n\n\n\nPENELOPE: Hey, Anna. What are you reading?\nANNA: I’m reading about fire safety. Ms. Weaver named me fire safety monitor.\nPENELOPE: But the only time we have a fire emergency is when someone burns a piece of toast. \nANNA: That is true. But fire safety is very serious – very serious. If there is a fire emergency, I have to help everyone out of the building.\nPENELOPE: Well then, if I were you, I’d learn as much as possible. \nANNA: You’re right. And I know just who to call!\nPROF. BOT: Hmm, I wonder where Anna’s going. Today we are reviewing conditionals and learning helpful language for emergencies.\nPROF. BOT: If Anna studies hard, she’ll be a great fire safety monitor! That’s a conditional. It uses “if” to show that something is true only when something else is true. \nPROF. BOT: Let’s find out where Anna is going. And if you want to learn fire emergency language, keep watching!\n(Two firefighters welcome Anna to their firehouse.)\nANNA: Hi, Firefighter Jones.\nFIREFIGHTER JONES: Hey, how are you, Anna?\nANNA: I’m well, thanks. How are you? Hi, Firefighter Hatcher.\nFIREFIGHTER HATCHER: Hi, Anna. How are you?\nANNA: I’m well, thanks.\nFF H: Welcome to our firehouse.\nANNA: Thank you.\nFF H: Come on in.\nANNA: Thanks.\nFF H: This is where the firefighters eat. This is where we rest. This is where we exercise. This is where the firetrucks are parked and maintained.\nANNA: This place is beautiful.\nFF H: You know, the firehouse is a firefighter’s second home.\nANNA: Firefighter Jones, Firefighter Hatcher: Can you tell me some ways to prepare for a fire emergency?\nFF H: Sure, Anna. There’s one really important thing you can do: Install a fire alarm. Test it monthly and make sure the batteries are fully charged.\nANNA: Let’s talk about those emergency exits.\nFF J: In your home, office and schools, know where your emergency exits are located.\nANNA: What about fire extinguishers?\n\nFF J: Everyone should know how to use a fire extinguisher. Have one handy and practice using it.\nANNA: What if we need to get out?\nFF J: You should have an evacuation plan. And practice getting out safely with fire drills. \n\nANNA: If I am in a building and it’s on fire, should I use the elevator?\nFF H: No. Always use the stairs.\nANNA: What other safety tips should I know?\nFF J: Stay low. Smoke rises. The air is clearer close to the ground.\nANNA: Stay low. Anything else?\nFF H: If you touch a door and it’s hot, don’t open it. There might be a fire on the other side.\nANNA: What do I do if my clothes catch on fire?\n\nFF H: Do not run. If you run, the fire will burn faster. You must stop, drop and roll.\nANNA: Thanks so much! I’ve learned a lot. And I can’t wait to share this information with others.\nFF H: Thanks for coming, Anna.\nFF J: It’s been a pleasure meeting you.\n(Anna is back at the office talking to Penelope.)\nPENELOPE: So, Anna, how was the visit to the fire station?\nANNA: I learned a lot! And firefighters have a very difficult job.\nPENELOPE: Do you smell smoke?\nANNA: No. So, like I was saying, I learned how to …\nPENELOPE: Anna, I smell smoke.\nANNA: If you smell smoke, call the fire department!\n(Anna begins to evacuate her coworkers.)\nANNA: If you smell smoke, get out of the building. Come on people, we have a fire emergency! Leave your things and evacuate calmly and quickly. Very good. Very good.\nANNA: We have a fire emergency. No, take the stairs Let’s get out. Let’s get out safely.\n(Anna and coworkers stand outside of the building.)\nANNA: We got out in less than 6 minutes! Good job, people! Wait. Where’s Pete?\nPENELOPE: I know where he is. I’ll go get him.\n\nANNA: No! Never go back into a burning building! The fire department is coming. Stay calm, Pete. Help is on the way!

    "dialog": "\n\nAnna talks to many coworkers about their dreams and plans for the future.\n\n\n\n\nASHLEY: Anna, where are you going in such a hurry?\nANNA: Hi, Ashley. The nurse’s office. Today I get the results from my blood test. \nASHLEY: I’m sure you’re fine. Don’t worry.\nANNA: You know, I used to dream of being a nurse. It is such an honorable career. Is there something you’ve dreamed of doing?\nASHLEY: Sure! I would love to be a dog trainer. Actually, I’ve taught my dog, Dublin, lots of tricks!\nANNA: Well, I’m off to the nurse. Bye, Ashley.\nASHLEY: Bye, Anna.\nANNA: Bye, Dublin.\n(Anna stands near the nurse’s office and listens to her phone call.)\nNURSE: I’m looking at her test results and they’re not good. In fact, I’m afraid she’s not going to make it.  \nANNA: What?! I'm not going to make it? I'm dying??\nNURSE: Anna, come in. How are you?\nANNA: I guess..not so good. I’m dying!?\nNURSE: What are you talking about?\nANNA: I just heard you on the phone. Just tell me: How much longer do I have?\nNURSE: I wasn't talking about you. A student of mine didn’t do well on her science test. So, she won’t be able to make it ... to graduation.\nANNA: Whew. Thank goodness! For a minute, my whole life passed before my eyes. There are so many things I haven't done yet.\nNURSE: Well, life is short. It’s important to do something you love every day. \nANNA: I couldn’t agree more.\nNURSE: Now, let’s talk about your blood test.

Hundreds of people are dancing together!\nPENELOPE: No way!\nANNA: Way! If you leave right now, you can join them! Bye!\n(Anna then sits with Pete in the office kitchen.)\nANNA: Pete, what’s one of your dreams?\nPETE: Well, last night I dreamt I was in a spaceship.
